jacob begat joseph the husband of mary of whom was born jesus who is called christ so all the generations from abraham unto david are fourteen generations and from david unto the carrying away to babylon fourteen generations and from the carrying away to babylon unto the christ fourteen generations now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when his mother mary had been betrothed to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy spirit and joseph her husband being a righteous man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily but when he thought on these things behold an angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy spirit and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for it is he that shall save his people from their sins now all this is come to pass that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the lord through the prophet saying behold the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name immanuel which is being interpreted god with us and joseph arose from his sleep and did as the angel of the lord commanded him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth a son and he called his name jesus now when jesus was born in bethlehem of jud a in the days of herod the king behold wise men from the east came to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we saw his star in the east and are come to worship him and when herod the king heard it he was troubled and all jerusalem with him and gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people he inquired of them where the christ should be born and they said unto him in bethlehem of jud a for thus it is written through the prophet and thou bethlehem land of judah art in no wise least among the princes of judah for out of thee shall come forth a governor who shall be shepherd of my people israel then herod privily called the wise men and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search out exactly concerning the young child and when ye have found him bring me word that i also may come and worship him and they having heard the king went their way and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was and when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and they came into the house and saw the young child with mary his mother and they fell down and worshipped him and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod they departed into their own country another way now when they were departed behold an angel of the lord appeareth to joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until i tell thee for herod will seek the young child to destroy him and he arose and took the young child and his mother by night and departed into egypt and was there until the death of herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the lord through the prophet saying out of egypt did i call my son then herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the male children that were in bethlehem and in all the borders thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had exactly learned of the wise men then was fulfilled that which was spoken through jeremiah the prophet saying a voice was heard in ramah weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and she would not be comforted because they are not but when herod was dead behold an angel of the lord appeareth in a dream to joseph in egypt saying arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of israel for they are dead that sought the young child s life and he arose and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of israel but when he heard that archelaus was reigning over jud a in the room of his father herod he was afraid to go thither and being warned of god in a dream he withdrew into the parts of galilee and came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets that he should be called a nazarene and in those days cometh john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of jud a saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand for this is he that was spoken of through isaiah the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness make ye ready the way of the lord make his paths straight now john himself had his raiment of camel s hair and a leathern girdle about his loins and his food was locusts and wild honey then went out unto him jerusalem and all jud a and all the region round about the jordan and they were baptized of him in the river jordan confessing their sins but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees coming to his baptism he said unto them ye offspring of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham and even now the axe lieth at the root of the trees every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire i indeed baptize you in water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you in the holy spirit and in fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor and he will gather his wheat into the garner but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire then cometh jesus from galilee to the jordan unto john to be baptized of him but john would have hindered him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me but jesus answering said unto him suffer it now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness then he suffereth him and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway from the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending as a dove and coming upon him and lo a voice out of the heavens saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he afterward hungered and the tempter came and said unto him if thou art the son of god command that these stones become bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god then the devil taketh him into the holy city and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou art the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and on their hands they shall bear thee up lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone jesus said unto him again it is written thou shalt not make trial of the lord thy god again the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and he said unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me then saith jesus unto him get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him now when he heard that john was delivered up he withdrew into galilee and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is by the sea in the borders of zebulun and naphtali that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet saying the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali toward the sea beyond the jordan galilee of the gentiles the people that sat in darkness saw a great light and to them that sat in the region and shadow of death to them did light spring up from that time began jesus to preach and to say repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand and walking by the sea of galilee he saw two brethren simon who is called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers and he saith unto them come ye after me and i will make you fishers of men and they straightway left the nets and followed him and going on from thence he saw two other brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother in the boat with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them and they straightway left the boat and their father and followed him and jesus went about in all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people and the report of him went forth into all syria and they brought unto him all that were sick holden with divers diseases and torments possessed with demons and epileptic and palsied and he healed them and there followed him great multitudes from galilee and decapolis and jerusalem and jud a and from beyond the jordan and seeing the multitudes he went up into the mountain and when he had sat down his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of god blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall reproach you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost its savor wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men ye are the light of the world a city set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a lamp and put it under the bushel but on the stand and it shineth unto all that are in the house even so let your light shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father who is in heaven think not that i came to destroy the law or the prophets i came not to destroy but to fulfil for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass away one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law till all things be accomplished whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven for i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven ye have heard that it was said to them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment but i say unto you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raca shall be in danger of the council and whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of the hell of fire if therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift agree with thine adversary quickly while thou art with him in the way lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into prison verily i say unto thee thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou have paid the last farthing ye have heard that it was said thou shalt not commit adultery but i say unto you that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart and if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not thy whole body be cast into hell and if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not thy whole body go into hell it was said also whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement but i say unto you that every one that putteth away his wife saving for the cause of fornication maketh her an adulteress and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery again ye have heard that it was said to them of old time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths but i say unto you swear not at all neither by the heaven for it is the throne of god nor by the earth for it is the footstool of his feet nor by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king neither shalt thou swear by thy head for thou canst not make one hair white or black but let your speech be yea yea nay nay and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil one ye have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say unto you resist not him that is evil but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man would go to law with thee and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile go with him two give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away ye have heard that it was said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies and pray for them that persecute you that ye may be sons of your father who is in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if ye love them that love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the gentiles the same ye therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men to be seen of them else ye have no reward with your father who is in heaven when therefore thou doest alms sound not a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men verily i say unto you they have received their reward but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth that thine alms may be in secret and thy father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee and when ye pray ye shall not be as the hypocrites for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have received their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thine inner chamber and having shut thy door pray to thy father who is in secret and thy father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee and in praying use not vain repetitions as the gentiles do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be not therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him after this manner therefore pray ye our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so on earth give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors and bring us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses moreover when ye fast be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may be seen of men to fast verily i say unto you they have received their reward but thou when thou fastest anoint thy head and wash thy face that thou be not seen of men to fast but of thy father who is in secret and thy father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth where moth and rust consume and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth consume and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where thy treasure is there will thy heart be also the lamp of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is the darkness no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon therefore i say unto you be not anxious for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on is not the life more than the food and the body than the raiment behold the birds of the heaven that they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns and your heavenly father feedeth them are not ye of much more value than they and which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his life and why are ye anxious concerning raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these but if god doth so clothe the grass of the field which to day is and to morrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith be not therefore anxious saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you be not therefore anxious for the morrow for the morrow will be anxious for itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother s eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me cast out the mote out of thine eye and lo the beam is in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother s eye give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast your pearls before the swine lest haply they trample them under their feet and turn and rend you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened or what man is there of you who if his son shall ask him for a loaf will give him a stone or if he shall ask for a fish will give him a serpent if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him all things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you even so do ye also unto them for this is the law and the prophets enter ye in by the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many are they that enter in thereby for narrow is the gate and straitened the way that leadeth unto life and few are they that find it beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep s clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves by their fruits ye shall know them do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire therefore by their fruits ye shall know them not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father who is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord did we not prophesy by thy name and by thy name cast out demons and by thy name do many mighty works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity every one therefore that heareth these words of mine and doeth them shall be likened unto a wise man who built his house upon the rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon the rock and every one that heareth these words of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man who built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and smote upon that house and it fell and great was the fall thereof and it came to pass when jesus had finished these words the multitudes were astonished at his teaching for he taught them as one having authority and not as their scribes and when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed him and behold there came to him a leper and worshipped him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean and he stretched forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou made clean and straightway his leprosy was cleansed and jesus saith unto him see thou tell no man but go show thyself to the priest and offer the gift that moses commanded for a testimony unto them and when he was entered into capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying lord my servant lieth in the house sick of the palsy grievously tormented and he saith unto him i will come and heal him and the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but only say the word and my servant shall be healed for i also am a man under authority having under myself soldiers and i say to this one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it and when jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth and jesus said unto the centurion go thy way as thou hast believed so be it done unto thee and the servant was healed in that hour and when jesus was come into peter s house he saw his wife s mother lying sick of a fever and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto him and when even was come they brought unto him many possessed with demons and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bare our diseases now when jesus saw great multitudes about him he gave commandment to depart unto the other side and there came a scribe and said unto him teacher i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest and jesus saith unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head and another of the disciples said unto him lord suffer me first to go and bury my father but jesus saith unto him follow me and leave the dead to bury their own dead and when he was entered into a boat his disciples followed him and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves but he was asleep and they came to him and awoke him saying save lord we perish and he saith unto them why are ye fearful o ye of little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm and the men marvelled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gadarenes there met him two possessed with demons coming forth out of the tombs exceeding fierce so that no man could pass by that way and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee thou son of god art thou come hither to torment us before the time now there was afar off from them a herd of many swine feeding and the demons besought him saying if thou cast us out send us away into the herd of swine and he said unto them go and they came out and went into the swine and behold the whole herd rushed down the steep into the sea and perished in the waters and they that fed them fled and went away into the city and told everything and what was befallen to them that were possessed with demons and behold all the city came out to meet jesus and when they saw him they besought him that he would depart from their borders and he entered into a boat and crossed over and came into his own city and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying on a bed and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy son be of good cheer thy sins are forgiven and behold certain of the scribes said within themselves this man blasphemeth and jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in your hearts for which is easier to say thy sins are forgiven or to say arise and walk but that ye may know that the son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the palsy arise and take up thy bed and go unto thy house and he arose and departed to his house but when the multitudes saw it they were afraid and glorified god who had given such authority unto men and as jesus passed by from thence he saw a man called matthew sitting at the place of toll and he saith unto him follow me and he arose and followed him and it came to pass as he sat at meat in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with jesus and his disciples and when the pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples why eateth your teacher with the publicans and sinners but when he heard it he said they that are whole have no need of a physician but they that are sick but go ye and learn what this meaneth i desire mercy and not sacrifice for i came not to call the righteous but sinners then come to him the disciples of john saying why do we and the pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not and jesus said unto them can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then will they fast and no man putteth a piece of undressed cloth upon an old garment for that which should fill it up taketh from the garment and a worse rent is made neither do men put new wine into old wine skins else the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins perish but they put new wine into fresh wine skins and both are preserved while he spake these things unto them behold there came a ruler and worshipped him saying my daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live and jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples and behold a woman who had an issue of blood twelve years came behind him and touched the border of his garment for she said within herself if i do but touch his garment i shall be made whole but jesus turning and seeing her said daughter be of good cheer thy faith hath made thee whole and the woman was made whole from that hour and when jesus came into the ruler s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a tumult he said give place for the damsel is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn but when the crowd was put forth he entered in and took her by the hand and the damsel arose and the fame hereof went forth into all that land and as jesus passed by from thence two blind men followed him crying out and saying have mercy on us thou son of david and when he was come into the house the blind men came to him and jesus saith unto them believe ye that i am able to do this they say unto him yea lord then touched he their eyes saying according to your faith be it done unto you and their eyes were opened and jesus strictly charged them saying see that no man know it but they went forth and spread abroad his fame in all that land and as they went forth behold there was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon and when the demon was cast out the dumb man spake and the multitudes marvelled saying it was never so seen in israel but the pharisees said by the prince of the demons casteth he out demons and jesus went about all the cities and the villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion for them because they were distressed and scattered as sheep not having a shepherd then saith he unto his disciples the harvest indeed is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he send forth laborers into his harvest and he called unto him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of disease and all manner of sickness now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simon who is called peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee and john his brother philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the publican james the son of alph us and thadd us simon the canan an and judas iscariot who also betrayed him these twelve jesus sent forth and charged them saying go not into any way of the gentiles and enter not into any city of the samaritans but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand heal the sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers cast out demons freely ye received freely give get you no gold nor silver nor brass in your purses no wallet for your journey neither two coats nor shoes nor staff for the laborer is worthy of his food and into whatsoever city or village ye shall enter search out who in it is worthy and there abide till ye go forth and as ye enter into the house salute it and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words as ye go forth out of that house or that city shake off the dust of your feet verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves but beware of men for they will deliver you up to councils and in their synagogues they will scourge you yea and before governors and kings shall ye be brought for my sake for a testimony to them and to the gentiles but when they deliver you up be not anxious how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father that speaketh in you and brother shall deliver up brother to death and the father his child and children shall rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death and ye shall be hated of all men for my name s sake but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved but when they persecute you in this city flee into the next for verily i say unto you ye shall not have gone through the cities of israel till the son of man be come a disciple is not above his teacher nor a servant above his lord it is enough for the disciple that he be as his teacher and the servant as his lord if they have called the master of the house beelzebub how much more them of his household fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known what i tell you in the darkness speak ye in the light and what ye hear in the ear proclaim upon the house tops and be not afraid of them that kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell are not two sparrows sold for a penny and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows every one therefore who shall confess me before men him will i also confess before my father who is in heaven but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father who is in heaven think not that i came to send peace on the earth i came not to send peace but a sword for i came to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law and a man s foes shall be they of his own household he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that doth not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet s reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man s reward and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward and it came to pass when jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities now when john heard in the prison the works of the christ he sent by his disciples and said unto him art thou he that cometh or look we for another and jesus answered and said unto them go and tell john the things which ye hear and see the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear and the dead are raised up and the poor have good tidings preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me and as these went their way jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness to behold a reed shaken with the wind but what went ye out to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they that wear soft raiment are in kings houses but wherefore went ye out to see a prophet yea i say unto you and much more than a prophet this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face who shall prepare thy way before thee verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than john the baptist yet he that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and men of violence take it by force for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john and if ye are willing to receive it this is elijah that is to come he that hath ears to hear let him hear but whereunto shall i liken this generation it is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces who call unto their fellows and say we piped unto you and ye did not dance we wailed and ye did not mourn for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he hath a demon the son of man came eating and drinking and they say behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners and wisdom is justified by her works then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done because they repented not woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon which were done in you they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes but i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon in the day of judgment than for you and thou capernaum shalt thou be exalted unto heaven thou shalt go down unto hades for if the mighty works had been done in sodom which were done in thee it would have remained until this day but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment than for thee at that season jesus answered and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding and didst reveal them unto babes yea father for so it was well pleasing in thy sight all things have been delivered unto me of my father and no one knoweth the son save the father neither doth any know the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son willeth to reveal him come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light at that season jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears and to eat but the pharisees when they saw it said unto him behold thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath but he said unto them have ye not read what david did when he was hungry and they that were with him how he entered into the house of god and ate the showbread which it was not lawful for him to eat neither for them that were with him but only for the priests or have ye not read in the law that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are guiltless but i say unto you that one greater than the temple is here but if ye had known what this meaneth i desire mercy and not sacrifice ye would not have condemned the guiltless for the son of man is lord of the sabbath and he departed thence and went into their synagogue and behold a man having a withered hand and they asked him saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day that they might accuse him and he said unto them what man shall there be of you that shall have one sheep and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day will he not lay hold on it and lift it out how much then is a man of more value than a sheep wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day then saith he to the man stretch forth thy hand and he stretched it forth and it was restored whole as the other but the pharisees went out and took counsel against him how they might destroy him and jesus perceiving it withdrew from thence and many followed him and he healed them all and charged them that they should not make him known that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet saying behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased i will put my spirit upon him and he shall declare judgment to the gentiles he shall not strive nor cry aloud neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets a bruised reed shall he not break and smoking flax shall he not quench till he send forth judgment unto victory and in his name shall the gentiles hope then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon blind and dumb and he healed him insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw and all the multitudes were amazed and said can this be the son of david but when the pharisees heard it they said this man doth not cast out demons but by beelzebub the prince of the demons and knowing their thoughts he said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand and if satan casteth out satan he is divided against himself how then shall his kingdom stand and if i by beelzebub cast out demons by whom do your sons cast them out therefore shall they be your judges but if i by the spirit of god cast out demons then is the kingdom of god come upon you or how can one enter into the house of the strong man and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth therefore i say unto you every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the spirit shall not be forgiven and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever shall speak against the holy spirit it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world nor in that which is to come either make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt for the tree is known by its fruit ye offspring of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh the good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things and i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned then certain of the scribes and pharisees answered him saying teacher we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of jonah the prophet for as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth the men of nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching of jonah and behold a greater than jonah is here the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here but the unclean spirit when he is gone out of the man passeth through waterless places seeking rest and findeth it not then he saith i will return into my house whence i came out and when he is come he findeth it empty swept and garnished then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this evil generation while he was yet speaking to the multitudes behold his mother and his brethren stood without seeking to speak to him and one said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without seeking to speak to thee but he answered and said unto him that told him who is my mother and who are my brethren and he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples and said behold my mother and my brethren for whosoever shall do the will of my father who is in heaven he is my brother and sister and mother on that day went jesus out of the house and sat by the sea side and there were gathered unto him great multitudes so that he entered into a boat and sat and all the multitude stood on the beach and he spake to them many things in parables saying behold the sower went forth to sow and as he sowed some seeds fell by the way side and the birds came and devoured them and others fell upon the rocky places where they had not much earth and straightway they sprang up because they had no deepness of earth and when the sun was risen they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away and others fell upon the thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them and others fell upon the good ground and yielded fruit some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty he that hath ears let him hear and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in parables and he answered and said unto them unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that which he hath therefore speak i to them in parables because seeing they see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall in no wise understand and seeing ye shall see and shall in no wise perceive for this people s heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest haply they should perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should turn again and i should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see and saw them not and to hear the things which ye hear and heard them not hear then ye the parable of the sower when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the evil one and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart this is he that was sown by the way side and he that was sown upon the rocky places this is he that heareth the word and straightway with joy receiveth it yet hath he not root in himself but endureth for a while and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word straightway he stumbleth and he that was sown among the thorns this is he that heareth the word and the care of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful and he that was sown upon the good ground this is he that heareth the word and understandeth it who verily beareth fruit and bringeth forth some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty another parable set he before them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat and went away but when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also and the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir didst thou not sow good seed in thy field whence then hath it tares and he said unto them an enemy hath done this and the servants say unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he saith nay lest haply while ye gather up the tares ye root up the wheat with them let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of the harvest i will say to the reapers gather up first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn another parable set he before them saying the kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field which indeed is less than all seeds but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becometh a tree so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof another parable spake he unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till it was all leavened all these things spake jesus in parables unto the multitudes and without a parable spake he nothing unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world then he left the multitudes and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field and he answered and said he that soweth the good seed is the son of man and the field is the world and the good seed these are the sons of the kingdom and the tares are the sons of the evil one and the enemy that sowed them is the devil and the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are angels as therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire so shall it be in the end of the world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling and them that do iniquity and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father he that hath ears let him hear the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field which a man found and hid and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls and having found one pearl of great price he went and sold all that he had and bought it again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind which when it was filled they drew up on the beach and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels but the bad they cast away so shall it be in the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the righteous and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth have ye understood all these things they say unto him yea and he said unto them therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old and it came to pass when jesus had finished these parables he departed thence and coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue insomuch that they were astonished and said whence hath this man this wisdom and these mighty works is not this the carpenter s son is not his mother called mary and his brethren james and joseph and simon and judas and his sisters are they not all with us whence then hath this man all these things and they were offended in him but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor save in his own country and in his own house and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief at that season herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning jesus and said unto his servants this is john the baptist he is risen from the dead and therefore do these powers work in him for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of herodias his brother philip s wife for john said unto him it is not lawful for thee to have her and when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophet but when herod s birthday came the daughter of herodias danced in the midst and pleased herod whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask and she being put forward by her mother saith give me here on a platter the head of john the baptist and the king was grieved but for the sake of his oaths and of them that sat at meat with him he commanded it to be given and he sent and beheaded john in the prison and his head was brought on a platter and given to the damsel and she brought it to her mother and his disciples came and took up the corpse and buried him and they went and told jesus now when jesus heard it he withdrew from thence in a boat to a desert place apart and when the multitudes heard thereof they followed him on foot from the cities and he came forth and saw a great multitude and he had compassion on them and healed their sick and when even was come the disciples came to him saying the place is desert and the time is already past send the multitudes away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food but jesus said unto them they have no need to go away give ye them to eat and they say unto him we have here but five loaves and two fishes and he said bring them hither to me and he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass and he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples and the disciples to the multitudes and they all ate and were filled and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces twelve baskets full and they that did eat were about five thousand men besides women and children and straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat and to go before him unto the other side till he should send the multitudes away and after he had sent the multitudes away he went up into the mountain apart to pray and when even was come he was there alone but the boat was now in the midst of the sea distressed by the waves for the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them walking upon the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a ghost and they cried out for fear but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee upon the waters and he said come and peter went down from the boat and walked upon the waters to come to jesus but when he saw the wind he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried out saying lord save me and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and took hold of him and saith unto him o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt and when they were gone up into the boat the wind ceased and they that were in the boat worshipped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god and when they had crossed over they came to the land unto gennesaret and when the men of that place knew him they sent into all that region round about and brought unto him all that were sick and they besought him that they might only touch the border of his garment and as many as touched were made whole then there come to jesus from jerusalem pharisees and scribes saying why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread and he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the commandment of god because of your tradition for god said honor thy father and thy mother and he that speaketh evil of father or mother let him die the death but ye say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother that wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given to god he shall not honor his father and ye have made void the word of god because of your tradition ye hypocrites well did isaiah prophesy of you saying this people honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men and he called to him the multitude and said unto them hear and understand not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man but that which proceedeth out of the mouth this defileth the man then came the disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the pharisees were offended when they heard this saying but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father planted not shall be rooted up let them alone they are blind guides and if the blind guide the blind both shall fall into a pit and peter answered and said unto him declare unto us the parable and he said are ye also even yet without understanding perceive ye not that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly and is cast out into the draught but the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart and they defile the man for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness railings these are the things which defile the man but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man and jesus went out thence and withdrew into the parts of tyre and sidon and behold a canaanitish woman came out from those borders and cried saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us but he answered and said i was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel but she came and worshipped him saying lord help me and he answered and said it is not meet to take the children s bread and cast it to the dogs but she said yea lord for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it done unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was healed from that hour and jesus departed thence and came nigh unto the sea of galilee and he went up into the mountain and sat there and there came unto him great multitudes having with them the lame blind dumb maimed and many others and they cast them down at his feet and he healed them insomuch that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb speaking the maimed whole and the lame walking and the blind seeing and they glorified the god of israel and jesus called unto him his disciples and said i have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat and i would not send them away fasting lest haply they faint on the way and the disciples say unto him whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude and jesus said unto them how many loaves have ye and they said seven and a few small fishes and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and the fishes and he gave thanks and brake and gave to the disciples and the disciples to the multitudes and they all ate and were filled and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces seven baskets full and they that did eat were four thousand men besides women and children and he sent away the multitudes and entered into the boat and came into the borders of magadan and the pharisees and sadducees came and trying him asked him to show them a sign from heaven but he answered and said unto them when it is evening ye say it will be fair weather for the heaven is red and in the morning it will be foul weather to day for the heaven is red and lowering ye know how to discern the face of the heaven but ye cannot discern the signs of the times an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of jonah and he left them and departed and the disciples came to the other side and forgot to take bread and jesus said unto them take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees and they reasoned among themselves saying we took no bread and jesus perceiving it said o ye of little faith why reason ye among yourselves because ye have no bread do ye not yet perceive neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets ye took up neither the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets ye took up how is it that ye do not perceive that i spake not to you concerning bread but beware of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees then understood they that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees now when jesus came into the parts of c sarea philippi he asked his disciples saying who do men say that the son of man is and they said some say john the baptist some elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets he saith unto them but who say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father who is in heaven and i also say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then charged he the disciples that they should tell no man that he was the christ from that time began jesus to show unto his disciples that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and the third day be raised up and peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shall never be unto thee but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art a stumbling block unto me for thou mindest not the things of god but the things of men then said jesus unto his disciples if any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever would save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it for what shall a man be profited if he shall gain the whole world and forfeit his life or what shall a man give in exchange for his life for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then shall he render unto every man according to his deeds verily i say unto you there are some of them that stand here who shall in no wise taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom and after six days jesus taketh with him peter and james and john his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his garments became white as the light and behold there appeared unto them moses and elijah talking with him and peter answered and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt i will make here three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elijah while he was yet speaking behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and lifting up their eyes they saw no one save jesus only and as they were coming down from the mountain jesus commanded them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen from the dead and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elijah must first come and he answered and said elijah indeed cometh and shall restore all things but i say unto you that elijah is come already and they knew him not but did unto him whatsoever they would even so shall the son of man also suffer of them then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of john the baptist and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a man kneeling to him and saying lord have mercy on my son for he is epileptic and suffereth grievously for oft times he falleth into the fire and oft times into the water and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him and jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i bear with you bring him hither to me and jesus rebuked him and the demon went out of him and the boy was cured from that hour then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could not we cast it out and he saith unto them because of your little faith for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you and while they abode in galilee jesus said unto them the son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men and they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raised up and they were exceeding sorry and when they were come to capernaum they that received the half shekel came to peter and said doth not your teacher pay the half shekel he saith yea and when he came into the house jesus spake first to him saying what thinkest thou simon the kings of the earth from whom do they receive toll or tribute from their sons or from strangers and when he said from strangers jesus said unto him therefore the sons are free but lest we cause them to stumble go thou to the sea and cast a hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a shekel that take and give unto them for me and thee in that hour came the disciples unto jesus saying who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and he called to him a little child and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except ye turn and become as little children ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me but whoso shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble it is profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck and that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling for it must needs be that the occasions come but woe to that man through whom the occasion cometh and if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to stumble cut it off and cast it from thee it is good for thee to enter into life maimed or halt rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire and if thine eye causeth thee to stumble pluck it out and cast it from thee it is good for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire see that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father who is in heaven how think ye if any man have a hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and go unto the mountains and seek that which goeth astray and if so be that he find it verily i say unto you he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray even so it is not the will of your father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish and if thy brother sin against thee go show him his fault between thee and him alone if he hear thee thou hast gained thy brother but if he hear thee not take with thee one or two more that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may be established and if he refuse to hear them tell it unto the church and if he refuse to hear the church also let him be unto thee as the gentile and the publican verily i say unto you what things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father who is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them then came peter and said to him lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him until seven times jesus saith unto him i say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king who would make a reckoning with his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him that owed him ten thousand talents but forasmuch as he had not wherewith to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying lord have patience with me and i will pay thee all and the lord of that servant being moved with compassion released him and forgave him the debt but that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred shillings and he laid hold on him and took him by the throat saying pay what thou owest so his fellow servant fell down and besought him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay that which was due so when his fellow servants saw what was done they were exceeding sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done then his lord called him unto him and saith to him thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou besoughtest me shouldest not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow servant even as i had mercy on thee and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due so shall also my heavenly father do unto you if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts and it came to pass when jesus had finished these words he departed from galilee and came into the borders of jud a beyond the jordan and great multitudes followed him and he healed them there and there came unto him pharisees trying him and saying is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said have ye not read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh so that they are no more two but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder they say unto him why then did moses command to give a bill of divorcement and to put her away he saith unto them moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it hath not been so and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and he that marrieth her when she is put away committeth adultery the disciples say unto him if the case of the man is so with his wife it is not expedient to marry but he said unto them not all men can receive this saying but they to whom it is given for there are eunuchs that were so born from their mother s womb and there are eunuchs that were made eunuchs by men and there are eunuchs that made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven s sake he that is able to receive it let him receive it then were there brought unto him little children that he should lay his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them but jesus said suffer the little children and forbid them not to come unto me for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven and he laid his hands on them and departed thence and behold one came to him and said teacher what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life and he said unto him why askest thou me concerning that which is good one there is who is good but if thou wouldest enter into life keep the commandments he saith unto him which and jesus said thou shalt not kill thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the young man saith unto him all these things have i observed what lack i yet jesus said unto him if thou wouldest be perfect go sell that which thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me but when the young man heard the saying he went away sorrowful for he was one that had great possessions and jesus said unto his disciples verily i say unto you it is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through a needle s eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and when the disciples heard it they were astonished exceedingly saying who then can be saved and jesus looking upon them said to them with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible then answered peter and said unto him lo we have left all and followed thee what then shall we have and jesus said unto them verily i say unto you that ye who have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel and every one that hath left houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for my name s sake shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit eternal life but many shall be last that are first and first that are last for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that was a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard and when he had agreed with the laborers for a shilling a day he sent them into his vineyard and he went out about the third hour and saw others standing in the marketplace idle and to them he said go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right i will give you and they went their way again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did likewise and about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing and he saith unto them why stand ye here all the day idle they say unto him because no man hath hired us he saith unto them go ye also into the vineyard and when even was come the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward call the laborers and pay them their hire beginning from the last unto the first and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour they received every man a shilling and when the first came they supposed that they would receive more and they likewise received every man a shilling and when they received it they murmured against the householder saying these last have spent but one hour and thou hast made them equal unto us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat but he answered and said to one of them friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for a shilling take up that which is thine and go thy way it is my will to give unto this last even as unto thee is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own or is thine eye evil because i am good so the last shall be first and the first last and as jesus was going up to jerusalem he took the twelve disciples apart and on the way he said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him unto the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify and the third day he shall be raised up then came to him the mother of the sons of zebedee with her sons worshipping him and asking a certain thing of him and he said unto her what wouldest thou she saith unto him command that these my two sons may sit one on thy right hand and one on thy left hand in thy kingdom but jesus answered and said ye know not what ye ask are ye able to drink the cup that i am about to drink they say unto him we are able he saith unto them my cup indeed ye shall drink but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it is for them for whom it hath been prepared of my father and when the ten heard it they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren but jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their great ones exercise authority over them not so shall it be among you but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many and as they went out from jericho a great multitude followed him and behold two blind men sitting by the way side when they heard that jesus was passing by cried out saying lord have mercy on us thou son of david and the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their peace but they cried out the more saying lord have mercy on us thou son of david and jesus stood still and called them and said what will ye that i should do unto you they say unto him lord that our eyes may be opened and jesus being moved with compassion touched their eyes and straightway they received their sight and followed him and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and came unto bethphage unto the mount of olives then jesus sent two disciples saying unto them go into the village that is over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loose them and bring them unto me and if any one say aught unto you ye shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them now this is come to pass that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of zion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass and the disciples went and did even as jesus appointed them and brought the ass and the colt and put on them their garments and he sat thereon and the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way and others cut branches from the trees and spread them in the way and the multitudes that went before him and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he was come into jerusalem all the city was stirred saying who is this and the multitudes said this is the prophet jesus from nazareth of galilee and jesus entered into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold the doves and he saith unto them it is written my house shall be called a house of prayer but ye make it a den of robbers and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children that were crying in the temple and saying hosanna to the son of david they were moved with indignation and said unto him hearest thou what these are saying and jesus saith unto them yea did ye never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise and he left them and went forth out of the city to bethany and lodged there now in the morning as he returned to the city he hungered and seeing a fig tree by the way side he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only and he saith unto it let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever and immediately the fig tree withered away and when the disciples saw it they marvelled saying how did the fig tree immediately wither away and jesus answered and said unto them verily i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree but even if ye shall say unto this mountain be thou taken up and cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive and when he was come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority and jesus answered and said unto them i also will ask you one question which if ye tell me i likewise will tell you by what authority i do these things the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or from men and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why then did ye not believe him but if we shall say from men we fear the multitude for all hold john as a prophet and they answered jesus and said we know not he also said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things but what think ye a man had two sons and he came to the first and said son go work to day in the vineyard and he answered and said i will not but afterward he repented himself and went and he came to the second and said likewise and he answered and said i go sir and went not which of the two did the will of his father they say the first jesus saith unto them verily i say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you for john came unto you in the way of righteousness and ye believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when ye saw it did not even repent yourselves afterward that ye might believe him hear another parable there was a man that was a householder who planted a vineyard and set a hedge about it and digged a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into another country and when the season of the fruits drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen to receive his fruits and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another again he sent other servants more than the first and they did unto them in like manner but afterward he sent unto them his son saying they will reverence my son but the husbandmen when they saw the son said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and take his inheritance and they took him and cast him forth out of the vineyard and killed him when therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come what will he do unto those husbandmen they say unto him he will miserably destroy those miserable men and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen who shall render him the fruits in their seasons jesus saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same was made the head of the corner this was from the lord and it is marvellous in our eyes therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken away from you and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof and he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces but on whomsoever it shall fall it will scatter him as dust and when the chief priests and the pharisees heard his parables they perceived that he spake of them and when they sought to lay hold on him they feared the multitudes because they took him for a prophet and jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king who made a marriage feast for his son and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast and they would not come again he sent forth other servants saying tell them that are bidden behold i have made ready my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come to the marriage feast but they made light of it and went their ways one to his own farm another to his merchandise and the rest laid hold on his servants and treated them shamefully and killed them but the king was wroth and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned their city then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they that were bidden were not worthy go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage feast and those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was filled with guests but when the king came in to behold the guests he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then the king said to the servants bind him hand and foot and cast him out into the outer darkness there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth for many are called but few chosen then went the pharisees and took counsel how they might ensnare him in his talk and they send to him their disciples with the herodians saying teacher we know that thou art true and teachest the way of god in truth and carest not for any one for thou regardest not the person of men tell us therefore what thinkest thou is it lawful to give tribute unto c sar or not but jesus perceived their wickedness and said why make ye trial of me ye hypocrites show me the tribute money and they brought unto him a denarius and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription they say unto him c sar s then saith he unto them render therefore unto c sar the things that are c sar s and unto god the things that are god s and when they heard it they marvelled and left him and went away on that day there came to him sadducees they that say that there is no resurrection and they asked him saying teacher moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother now there were with us seven brethren and the first married and deceased and having no seed left his wife unto his brother in like manner the second also and the third unto the seventh and after them all the woman died in the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven for they all had her but jesus answered and said unto them ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as angels in heaven but as touching the resurrection of the dead have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob god is not the god of the dead but of the living and when the multitudes heard it they were astonished at his teaching but the pharisees when they heard that he had put the sadducees to silence gathered themselves together and one of them a lawyer asked him a question trying him teacher which is the great commandment in the law and he said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the great and first commandment and a second like unto it is this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments the whole law hangeth and the prophets now while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them a question saying what think ye of the christ whose son is he they say unto him the son of david he saith unto them how then doth david in the spirit call him lord saying the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i put thine enemies underneath thy feet if david then calleth him lord how is he his son and no one was able to answer him a word neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions then spake jesus to the multitudes and to his disciples saying the scribes and the pharisees sit on moses seat all things therefore whatsoever they bid you these do and observe but do not ye after their works for they say and do not yea they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on men s shoulders but they themselves will not move them with their finger but all their works they do to be seen of men for they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments and love the chief place at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues and the salutations in the marketplaces and to be called of men rabbi but be not ye called rabbi for one is your teacher and all ye are brethren and call no man your father on the earth for one is your father even he who is in heaven neither be ye called masters for one is your master even the christ but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because ye shut the kingdom of heaven against men for ye enter not in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering in to enter woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is become so ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves woe unto you ye blind guides that say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor ye fools and blind for which is greater the gold or the temple that hath sanctified the gold and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it he is a debtor ye blind for which is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift he therefore that sweareth by the altar sweareth by it and by all things thereon and he that sweareth by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein and he that sweareth by the heaven sweareth by the throne of god and by him that sitteth thereon woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye tithe mint and anise and cummin and have left undone the weightier matters of the law justice and mercy and faith but these ye ought to have done and not to have left the other undone ye blind guides that strain out the gnat and swallow the camel woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full from extortion and excess thou blind pharisee cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter that the outside thereof may become clean also woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which outwardly appear beautiful but inwardly are full of dead men s bones and of all uncleanness even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and garnish the tombs of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets wherefore ye witness to yourselves that ye are sons of them that slew the prophets fill ye up then the measure of your fathers ye serpents ye offspring of vipers how shall ye escape the judgment of hell therefore behold i send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes some of them shall ye kill and crucify and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth from the blood of abel the righteous unto the blood of zachariah son of barachiah whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the altar verily i say unto you all these things shall come upon this generation o jerusalem jerusalem that killeth the prophets and stoneth them that are sent unto her how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate for i say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord and jesus went out from the temple and was going on his way and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple but he answered and said unto them see ye not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat on the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man lead you astray for many shall come in my name saying i am the christ and shall lead many astray and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled for these things must needs come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and earthquakes in divers places but all these things are the beginning of travail then shall they deliver you up unto tribulation and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all the nations for my name s sake and then shall many stumble and shall deliver up one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall arise and shall lead many astray and because iniquity shall be multiplied the love of the many shall wax cold but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations and then shall the end come when therefore ye see the abomination of desolation which was spoken of through daniel the prophet standing in the holy place let him that readeth understand then let them that are in jud a flee unto the mountains let him that is on the housetop not go down to take out the things that are in his house and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on a sabbath for then shall be great tribulation such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now no nor ever shall be and except those days had been shortened no flesh would have been saved but for the elect s sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall say unto you lo here is the christ or here believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray if possible even the elect behold i have told you beforehand if therefore they shall say unto you behold he is in the wilderness go not forth behold he is in the inner chambers believe it not for as the lightning cometh forth from the east and is seen even unto the west so shall be the coming of the son of man wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagles be gathered together but immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory and he shall send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other now from the fig tree learn her parable when her branch is now become tender and putteth forth its leaves ye know that the summer is nigh even so ye also when ye see all these things know ye that he is nigh even at the doors verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all these things be accomplished heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but of that day and hour knoweth no one not even the angels of heaven neither the son but the father only and as were the days of noah so shall be the coming of the son of man for as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and they knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall be the coming of the son of man then shall two men be in the field one is taken and one is left two women shall be grinding at the mill one is taken and one is left watch therefore for ye know not on what day your lord cometh but know this that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken through therefore be ye also ready for in an hour that ye think not the son of man cometh who then is the faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath set over his household to give them their food in due season blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing verily i say unto you that he will set him over all that he hath but if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord tarrieth and shall begin to beat his fellow servants and shall eat and drink with the drunken the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not and in an hour when he knoweth not and shall cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were foolish and five were wise for the foolish when they took their lamps took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps now while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept but at midnight there is a cry behold the bridegroom come ye forth to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answered saying peradventure there will not be enough for us and you go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went away to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for ye know not the day nor the hour for it is as when a man going into another country called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods and unto one he gave five talents to another two to another one to each according to his several ability and he went on his journey straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them and made other five talents in like manner he also that received the two gained other two but he that received the one went away and digged in the earth and hid his lord s money now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh and maketh a reckoning with them and he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents saying lord thou deliveredst unto me five talents lo i have gained other five talents his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will set thee over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord and he also that received the two talents came and said lord thou deliveredst unto me two talents lo i have gained other two talents his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will set thee over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord and he also that had received the one talent came and said lord i knew thee that thou art a hard man reaping where thou didst not sow and gathering where thou didst not scatter and i was afraid and went away and hid thy talent in the earth lo thou hast thine own but his lord answered and said unto him thou wicked and slothful servant thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not and gather where i did not scatter thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers and at my coming i should have received back mine own with interest take ye away therefore the talent from him and give it unto him that hath the ten talents for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not even that which he hath shall be taken away and cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth but when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the angels with him then shall he sit on the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all the nations and he shall separate them one from another as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was hungry and ye gave me to eat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee hungry and fed thee or athirst and gave thee drink and when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee and when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren even these least ye did it unto me then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels for i was hungry and ye did not give me to eat i was thirsty and ye gave me no drink i was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not then shall they also answer saying lord when saw we thee hungry or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least ye did it not unto me and these shall go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life and it came to pass when jesus had finished all these words he said unto his disciples ye know that after two days the passover cometh and the son of man is delivered up to be crucified then were gathered together the chief priests and the elders of the people unto the court of the high priest who was called caiaphas and they took counsel together that they might take jesus by subtlety and kill him but they said not during the feast lest a tumult arise among the people now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment and she poured it upon his head as he sat at meat but when the disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor but jesus perceiving it said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always for in that she poured this ointment upon my body she did it to prepare me for burial verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her then one of the twelve who was called judas iscariot went unto the chief priests and said what are ye willing to give me and i will deliver him unto you and they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver and from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him unto them now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover and he said go into the city to such a man and say unto him the teacher saith my time is at hand i keep the passover at thy house with my disciples and the disciples did as jesus appointed them and they made ready the passover now when even was come he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples and as they were eating he said verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me and they were exceeding sorrowful and began to say unto him every one is it i lord and he answered and said he that dipped his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me the son of man goeth even as it is written of him but woe unto that man through whom the son of man is betrayed good were it for that man if he had not been born and judas who betrayed him answered and said is it i rabbi he saith unto him thou hast said and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed and brake it and he gave to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took a cup and gave thanks and gave to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many unto remission of sins but i say unto you i shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my father s kingdom and when they had sung a hymn they went out into the mount of olives then saith jesus unto them all ye shall be offended in me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after i am raised up i will go before you into galilee but peter answered and said unto him if all shall be offended in thee i will never be offended jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee that this night before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice peter saith unto him even if i must die with thee yet will i not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and saith unto his disciples sit ye here while i go yonder and pray and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death abide ye here and watch with me and he went forward a little and fell on his face and prayed saying my father if it be possible let this cup pass away from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them sleeping and saith unto peter what could ye not watch with me one hour watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak again a second time he went away and prayed saying my father if this cannot pass away except i drink it thy will be done and he came again and found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy and he left them again and went away and prayed a third time saying again the same words then cometh he to the disciples and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners arise let us be going behold he is at hand that betrayeth me and while he yet spake lo judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever i shall kiss that is he take him and straightway he came to jesus and said hail rabbi and kissed him and jesus said unto him friend do that for which thou art come then they came and laid hands on jesus and took him and behold one of them that were with jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and smote the servant of the high priest and struck off his ear then saith jesus unto him put up again thy sword into its place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword or thinkest thou that i cannot beseech my father and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels how then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be in that hour said jesus to the multitudes are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me i sat daily in the temple teaching and ye took me not but all this is come to pass that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled then all the disciples left him and fled and they that had taken jesus led him away to the house of caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were gathered together but peter followed him afar off unto the court of the high priest and entered in and sat with the officers to see the end now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against jesus that they might put him to death and they found it not though many false witnesses came but afterward came two and said this man said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days and the high priest stood up and said unto him answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee but jesus held his peace and the high priest said unto him i adjure thee by the living god that thou tell us whether thou art the christ the son of god jesus saith unto him thou hast said nevertheless i say unto you henceforth ye shall see the son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven then the high priest rent his garments saying he hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses behold now ye have heard the blasphemy what think ye they answered and said he is worthy of death then did they spit in his face and buffet him and some smote him with the palms of their hands saying prophesy unto us thou christ who is he that struck thee now peter was sitting without in the court and a maid came unto him saying thou also wast with jesus the galil an but he denied before them all saying i know not what thou sayest and when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and saith unto them that were there this man also was with jesus of nazareth and again he denied with an oath i know not the man and after a little while they that stood by came and said to peter of a truth thou also art one of them for thy speech maketh thee known then began he to curse and to swear i know not the man and straightway the cock crew and peter remembered the word which jesus had said before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly now when morning was come all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death and they bound him and led him away and delivered him up to pilate the governor then judas who betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders saying i have sinned in that i betrayed innocent blood but they said what is that to us see thou to it and he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary and departed and he went away and hanged himself and the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said it is not lawful to put them into the treasury since it is the price of blood and they took counsel and bought with them the potter s field to bury strangers in wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this day then was fulfilled that which was spoken through jeremiah the prophet saying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was priced whom certain of the children of israel did price and they gave them for the potter s field as the lord appointed me now jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and jesus said unto him thou sayest and when he was accused by the chief priests and elders he answered nothing then saith pilate unto him hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee and he gave him no answer not even to one word insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner whom they would and they had then a notable prisoner called barabbas when therefore they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that i release unto you barabbas or jesus who is called christ for he knew that for envy they had delivered him up and while he was sitting on the judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have thou nothing to do with that righteous man for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for barabbas and destroy jesus but the governor answered and said unto them which of the two will ye that i release unto you and they said barabbas pilate saith unto them what then shall i do unto jesus who is called christ they all say let him be crucified and he said why what evil hath he done but they cried out exceedingly saying let him be crucified so when pilate saw that he prevailed nothing but rather that a tumult was arising he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this righteous man see ye to it and all the people answered and said his blood be on us and on our children then released he unto them barabbas but jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the pr torium and gathered unto him the whole band and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe and they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they kneeled down before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews and they spat upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head and when they had mocked him they took off from him the robe and put on him his garments and led him away to crucify him and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by name him they compelled to go with them that he might bear his cross and when they were come unto a place called golgotha that is to say the place of a skull they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted it he would not drink and when they had crucified him they parted his garments among them casting lots and they sat and watched him there and they set up over his head his accusation written this is jesus the king of the jews then are there crucified with him two robbers one on the right hand and one on the left and they that passed by railed on him wagging their heads and saying thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself if thou art the son of god come down from the cross in like manner also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said he saved others himself he cannot save he is the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe on him he trusteth on god let him deliver him now if he desireth him for he said i am the son of god and the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and some of them that stood there when they heard it said this man calleth elijah and straightway one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink and the rest said let be let us see whether elijah cometh to save him and jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit and behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks were rent and the tombs were opened and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many now the centurion and they that were with him watching jesus when they saw the earthquake and the things that were done feared exceedingly saying truly this was the son of god and many women were there beholding from afar who had followed jesus from galilee ministering unto him among whom was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joses and the mother of the sons of zebedee and when even was come there came a rich man from arimath a named joseph who also himself was jesus disciple this man went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus then pilate commanded it to be given up and joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn out in the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and departed and mary magdalene was there and the other mary sitting over against the sepulchre now on the morrow which is the day after the preparation the chief priests and the pharisees were gathered together unto pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days i rise again command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day lest haply his disciples come and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead and the last error will be worse than the first pilate said unto them ye have a guard go make it as sure as ye can so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone the guard being with them now late on the sabbath day as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre and behold there was a great earthquake for an angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it his appearance was as lightning and his raiment white as snow and for fear of him the watchers did quake and became as dead men and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus who hath been crucified he is not here for he is risen even as he said come see the place where the lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples he is risen from the dead and lo he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him lo i have told you and they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to bring his disciples word and behold jesus met them saying all hail and they came and took hold of his feet and worshipped him then saith jesus unto them fear not go tell my brethren that they depart into galilee and there shall they see me now while they were going behold some of the guard came into the city and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave much money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governor s ears we will persuade him and rid you of care so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying was spread abroad among the jews and continueth until this day but the eleven disciples went into galilee unto the mountain where jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshipped him but some doubted and jesus came to them and spake unto them saying all authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth go ye therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them into the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god even as it is written in isaiah the prophet behold i send my messenger before thy face who shall prepare thy way the voice of one crying in the wilderness make ye ready the way of the lord make his paths straight john came who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins and there went out unto him all the country of jud a and all they of jerusalem and they were baptized of him in the river jordan confessing their sins and john was clothed with camel s hair and had a leathern girdle about his loins and did eat locusts and wild honey and he preached saying there cometh after me he that is mightier than i the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose i baptized you in water but he shall baptize you in the holy spirit and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized of john in the jordan and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens rent asunder and the spirit as a dove descending upon him and a voice came out of the heavens thou art my beloved son in thee i am well pleased and straightway the spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness and he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of satan and he was with the wild beasts and the angels ministered unto him now after john was delivered up jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of god and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe in the gospel and passing along by the sea of galilee he saw simon and andrew the brother of simon casting a net in the sea for they were fishers and jesus said unto them come ye after me and i will make you to become fishers of men and straightway they left the nets and followed him and going on a little further he saw james the son of zebedee and john his brother who also were in the boat mending the nets and straightway he called them and they left their father zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and went after him and they go into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught and they were astonished at his teaching for he taught them as having authority and not as the scribes and straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out saying what have we to do with thee jesus thou nazarene art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him and the unclean spirit tearing him and crying with a loud voice came out of him and they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among themselves saying what is this a new teaching with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits and they obey him and the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of galilee round about and straightway when they were come out of the synagogue they came into the house of simon and andrew with james and john now simon s wife s mother lay sick of a fever and straightway they tell him of her and he came and took her by the hand and raised her up and the fever left her and she ministered unto them and at even when the sun did set they brought unto him all that were sick and them that were possessed with demons and all the city was gathered together at the door and he healed many that were sick with divers diseases and cast out many demons and he suffered not the demons to speak because they knew him and in the morning a great while before day he rose up and went out and departed into a desert place and there prayed and simon and they that were with him followed after him and they found him and say unto him all are seeking thee and he saith unto them let us go elsewhere into the next towns that i may preach there also for to this end came i forth and he went into their synagogues throughout all galilee preaching and casting out demons and there cometh to him a leper beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean and being moved with compassion he stretched forth his hand and touched him and saith unto him i will be thou made clean and straightway the leprosy departed from him and he was made clean and he strictly charged him and straightway sent him out and saith unto him see thou say nothing to any man but go show thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing the things which moses commanded for a testimony unto them but he went out and began to publish it much and to spread abroad the matter insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter into a city but was without in desert places and they came to him from every quarter and when he entered again into capernaum after some days it was noised that he was in the house and many were gathered together so that there was no longer room for them no not even about the door and he spake the word unto them and they come bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy borne of four and when they could not come nigh unto him for the crowd they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay and jesus seeing their faith saith unto the sick of the palsy son thy sins are forgiven but there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts why doth this man thus speak he blasphemeth who can forgive sins but one even god and straightway jesus perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves saith unto them why reason ye these things in your hearts which is easier to say to the sick of the palsy thy sins are forgiven or to say arise and take up thy bed and walk but that ye may know that the son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins he saith to the sick of the palsy i say unto thee arise take up thy bed and go unto thy house and he arose and straightway took up the bed and went forth before them all insomuch that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we never saw it on this fashion and he went forth again by the sea side and all the multitude resorted unto him and he taught them and as he passed by he saw levi the son of alph us sitting at the place of toll and he saith unto him follow me and he arose and followed him and it came to pass that he was sitting at meat in his house and many publicans and sinners sat down with jesus and his disciples for there were many and they followed him and the scribes of the pharisees when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and publicans said unto his disciples how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners and when jesus heard it he saith unto them they that are whole have no need of a physician but they that are sick i came not to call the righteous but sinners and john s disciples and the pharisees were fasting and they come and say unto him why do john s disciples and the disciples of the pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not and jesus said unto them can the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then will they fast in that day no man seweth a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment else that which should fill it up taketh from it the new from the old and a worse rent is made and no man putteth new wine into old wine skins else the wine will burst the skins and the wine perisheth and the skins but they put new wine into fresh wine skins and it came to pass that he was going on the sabbath day through the grainfields and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears and the pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful and he said unto them did ye never read what david did when he had need and was hungry he and they that were with him how he entered into the house of god when abiathar was high priest and ate the showbread which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests and gave also to them that were with him and he said unto them the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath so that the son of man is lord even of the sabbath and he entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there who had his hand withered and they watched him whether he would heal him on the sabbath day that they might accuse him and he saith unto the man that had his hand withered stand forth and he saith unto them is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good or to do harm to save a life or to kill but they held their peace and when he had looked round about on them with anger being grieved at the hardening of their heart he saith unto the man stretch forth thy hand and he stretched it forth and his hand was restored and the pharisees went out and straightway with the herodians took counsel against him how they might destroy him and jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea and a great multitude from galilee followed and from jud a and from jerusalem and from idum a and beyond the jordan and about tyre and sidon a great multitude hearing what great things he did came unto him and he spake to his disciples that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd lest they should throng him for he had healed many insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him and the unclean spirits whensoever they beheld him fell down before him and cried saying thou art the son of god and he charged them much that they should not make him known and he goeth up into the mountain and calleth unto him whom he himself would and they went unto him and he appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them forth to preach and to have authority to cast out demons and simon he surnamed peter and james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james and them he surnamed boanerges which is sons of thunder and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james the son of alph us and thadd us and simon the canan an and judas iscariot who also betrayed him and he cometh into a house and the multitude cometh together again so that they could not so much as eat bread and when his friends heard it they went out to lay hold on him for they said he is beside himself and the scribes that came down from jerusalem said he hath beelzebub and by the prince of the demons casteth he out the demons and he called them unto him and said unto them in parables how can satan cast out satan and if a kingdom be divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand and if a house be divided against itself that house will not be able to stand and if satan hath risen up against himself and is divided he cannot stand but hath an end but no one can enter into the house of the strong man and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house verily i say unto you all their sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme but whosoever shall blaspheme against the holy spirit hath never forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin because they said he hath an unclean spirit and there come his mother and his brethren and standing without they sent unto him calling him and a multitude was sitting about him and they say unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee and he answereth them and saith who is my mother and my brethren and looking round on them that sat round about him he saith behold my mother and my brethren for whosoever shall do the will of god the same is my brother and sister and mother and again he began to teach by the sea side and there is gathered unto him a very great multitude so that he entered into a boat and sat in the sea and all the multitude were by the sea on the land and he taught them many things in parables and said unto them in his teaching hearken behold the sower went forth to sow and it came to pass as he sowed some seed fell by the way side and the birds came and devoured it and other fell on the rocky ground where it had not much earth and straightway it sprang up because it had no deepness of earth and when the sun was risen it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away and other fell among the thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit and others fell into the good ground and yielded fruit growing up and increasing and brought forth thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold and he said who hath ears to hear let him hear and when he was alone they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables and he said unto them unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all things are done in parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest haply they should turn again and it should be forgiven them and he saith unto them know ye not this parable and how shall ye know all the parables the sower soweth the word and these are they by the way side where the word is sown and when they have heard straightway cometh satan and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them and these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky places who when they have heard the word straightway receive it with joy and they have no root in themselves but endure for a while then when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word straightway they stumble and others are they that are sown among the thorns these are they that have heard the word and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful and those are they that were sown upon the good ground such as hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold and he said unto them is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel or under the bed and not to be put on the stand for there is nothing hid save that it should be manifested neither was anything made secret but that it should come to light if any man hath ears to hear let him hear and he said unto them take heed what ye hear with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you and more shall be given unto you for he that hath to him shall be given and he that hath not from him shall be taken away even that which he hath and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed upon the earth and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring up and grow he knoweth not how the earth beareth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear then the full grain in the ear but when the fruit is ripe straightway he putteth forth the sickle because the harvest is come and he said how shall we liken the kingdom of god or in what parable shall we set it forth it is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown upon the earth though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth yet when it is sown groweth up and becometh greater than all the herbs and putteth out great branches so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof and with many such parables spake he the word unto them as they were able to hear it and without a parable spake he not unto them but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things and on that day when even was come he saith unto them let us go over unto the other side and leaving the multitude they take him with them even as he was in the boat and other boats were with him and there ariseth a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the boat insomuch that the boat was now filling and he himself was in the stern asleep on the cushion and they awake him and say unto him teacher carest thou not that we perish and he awoke and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are ye fearful have ye not yet faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him and they came to the other side of the sea into the country of the gerasenes and when he was come out of the boat straightway there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit who had his dwelling in the tombs and no man could any more bind him no not with a chain because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been rent asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces and no man had strength to tame him and always night and day in the tombs and in the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones and when he saw jesus from afar he ran and worshipped him and crying out with a loud voice he saith what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god i adjure thee by god torment me not for he said unto him come forth thou unclean spirit out of the man and he asked him what is thy name and he saith unto him my name is legion for we are many and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding and they besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them and he gave them leave and the unclean spirits came out and entered into the swine and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea in number about two thousand and they were drowned in the sea and they that fed them fled and told it in the city and in the country and they came to see what it was that had come to pass and they come to jesus and behold him that was possessed with demons sitting clothed and in his right mind even him that had the legion and they were afraid and they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons and concerning the swine and they began to beseech him to depart from their borders and as he was entering into the boat he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him and he suffered him not but saith unto him go to thy house unto thy friends and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee and how he had mercy on thee and he went his way and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him and all men marvelled and when jesus had crossed over again in the boat unto the other side a great multitude was gathered unto him and he was by the sea and there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue ja rus by name and seeing him he falleth at his feet and beseecheth him much saying my little daughter is at the point of death i pray thee that thou come and lay thy hands on her that she may be made whole and live and he went with him and a great multitude followed him and they thronged him and a woman who had an issue of blood twelve years and had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse having heard the things concerning jesus came in the crowd behind and touched his garment for she said if i touch but his garments i shall be made whole and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague and straightway jesus perceiving in himself that the power proceeding from him had gone forth turned him about in the crowd and said who touched my garments and his disciples said unto him thou seest the multitude thronging thee and sayest thou who touched me and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what had been done to her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague while he yet spake they come from the ruler of the synagogue s house saying thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the teacher any further but jesus not heeding the word spoken saith unto the ruler of the synagogue fear not only believe and he suffered no man to follow with him save peter and james and john the brother of james and they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and he beholdeth a tumult and many weeping and wailing greatly and when he was entered in he saith unto them why make ye a tumult and weep the child is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn but he having put them all forth taketh the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him and goeth in where the child was and taking the child by the hand he saith unto her talitha cumi which is being interpreted damsel i say unto thee arise and straightway the damsel rose up and walked for she was twelve years old and they were amazed straightway with a great amazement and he charged them much that no man should know this and he commanded that something should be given her to eat and he went out from thence and he cometh into his own country and his disciples follow him and when the sabbath was come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying whence hath this man these things and what is the wisdom that is given unto this man and what mean such mighty works wrought by his hands is not this the carpenter the son of mary and brother of james and joses and judas and simon and are not his sisters here with us and they were offended in him and jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor save in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house and he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them and he marvelled because of their unbelief and he went round about the villages teaching and he calleth unto him the twelve and began to send them forth by two and two and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits and he charged them that they should take nothing for their journey save a staff only no bread no wallet no money in their purse but to go shod with sandals and said he put not on two coats and he said unto them wheresoever ye enter into a house there abide till ye depart thence and whatsoever place shall not receive you and they hear you not as ye go forth thence shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony unto them and they went out and preached that men should repent and they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them and king herod heard thereof for his name had become known and he said john the baptizer is risen from the dead and therefore do these powers work in him but others said it is elijah and others said it is a prophet even as one of the prophets but herod when he heard thereof said john whom i beheaded he is risen for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and bound him in prison for the sake of herodias his brother philip s wife for he had married her for john said unto herod it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother s wife and herodias set herself against him and desired to kill him and she could not for herod feared john knowing that he was a righteous and holy man and kept him safe and when he heard him he was much perplexed and he heard him gladly and when a convenient day was come that herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords and the high captains and the chief men of galilee and when the daughter of herodias herself came in and danced she pleased herod and them that sat at meat with him and the king said unto the damsel ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and i will give it thee and he sware unto her whatsoever thou shalt ask of me i will give it thee unto the half of my kingdom and she went out and said unto her mother what shall i ask and she said the head of john the baptizer and she came in straightway with haste unto the king and asked saying i will that thou forthwith give me on a platter the head of john the baptist and the king was exceeding sorry but for the sake of his oaths and of them that sat at meat he would not reject her and straightway the king sent forth a soldier of his guard and commanded to bring his head and he went and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the damsel and the damsel gave it to her mother and when his disciples heard thereof they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb and the apostles gather themselves together unto jesus and they told him all things whatsoever they had done and whatsoever they had taught and he saith unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat and they went away in the boat to a desert place apart and the people saw them going and many knew them and they ran together there on foot from all the cities and outwent them and he came forth and saw a great multitude and he had compassion on them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said the place is desert and the day is now far spent send them away that they may go into the country and villages round about and buy themselves somewhat to eat but he answered and said unto them give ye them to eat and they say unto him shall we go and buy two hundred shillings worth of bread and give them to eat and he saith unto them how many loaves have ye go and see and when they knew they say five and two fishes and he commanded them that all should sit down by companies upon the green grass and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties and he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed and brake the loaves and he gave to the disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he among them all and they all ate and were filled and they took up broken pieces twelve basketfuls and also of the fishes and they that ate the loaves were five thousand men and straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the boat and to go before him unto the other side to bethsaida while he himself sendeth the multitude away and after he had taken leave of them he departed into the mountain to pray and when even was come the boat was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land and seeing them distressed in rowing for the wind was contrary unto them about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walking on the sea and he would have passed by them but they when they saw him walking on the sea supposed that it was a ghost and cried out for they all saw him and were troubled but he straightway spake with them and saith unto them be of good cheer it is i be not afraid and he went up unto them into the boat and the wind ceased and they were sore amazed in themselves for they understood not concerning the loaves but their heart was hardened and when they had crossed over they came to the land unto gennesaret and moored to the shore and when they were come out of the boat straightway the people knew him and ran round about that whole region and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick where they heard he was and wheresoever he entered into villages or into cities or into the country they laid the sick in the marketplaces and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment and as many as touched him were made whole and there are gathered together unto him the pharisees and certain of the scribes who had come from jerusalem and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled that is unwashen hands for the pharisees and all the jews except they wash their hands diligently eat not holding the tradition of the elders and when they come from the marketplace except they bathe themselves they eat not and many other things there are which they have received to hold washings of cups and pots and brasen vessels and the pharisees and the scribes ask him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat their bread with defiled hands and he said unto them well did isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites as it is written this people honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men ye leave the commandment of god and hold fast the tradition of men and he said unto them full well do ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your tradition for moses said honor thy father and thy mother and he that speaketh evil of father or mother let him die the death but ye say if a man shall say to his father or his mother that wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is corban that is to say given to god ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother making void the word of god by your tradition which ye have delivered and many such like things ye do and he called to him the multitude again and said unto them hear me all of you and understand there is nothing from without the man that going into him can defile him but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man and when he was entered into the house from the multitude his disciples asked of him the parable and he saith unto them are ye so without understanding also perceive ye not that whatsoever from without goeth into the man it cannot defile him because it goeth not into his heart but into his belly and goeth out into the draught this he said making all meats clean and he said that which proceedeth out of the man that defileth the man for from within out of the heart of men evil thoughts proceed fornications thefts murders adulteries covetings wickednesses deceit lasciviousness an evil eye railing pride foolishness all these evil things proceed from within and defile the man and from thence he arose and went away into the borders of tyre and sidon and he entered into a house and would have no man know it and he could not be hid but straightway a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit having heard of him came and fell down at his feet now the woman was a greek a syrophoenician by race and she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter and he said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not meet to take the children s bread and cast it to the dogs but she answered and saith unto him yea lord even the dogs under the table eat of the children s crumbs and he said unto her for this saying go thy way the demon is gone out of thy daughter and she went away unto her house and found the child laid upon the bed and the demon gone out and again he went out from the borders of tyre and came through sidon unto the sea of galilee through the midst of the borders of decapolis and they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him and he took him aside from the multitude privately and put his fingers into his ears and he spat and touched his tongue and looking up to heaven he sighed and saith unto him ephphatha that is be opened and his ears were opened and the bond of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain and he charged them that they should tell no man but the more he charged them so much the more a great deal they published it and they were beyond measure astonished saying he hath done all things well he maketh even the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak in those days when there was again a great multitude and they had nothing to eat he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them i have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat and if i send them away fasting to their home they will faint on the way and some of them are come from far and his disciples answered him whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place and he asked them how many loaves have ye and they said seven and he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and having given thanks he brake and gave to his disciples to set before them and they set them before the multitude and they had a few small fishes and having blessed them he commanded to set these also before them and they ate and were filled and they took up of broken pieces that remained over seven baskets and they were about four thousand and he sent them away and straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples and came into the parts of dalmanutha and the pharisees came forth and began to question with him seeking of him a sign from heaven trying him and he sighed deeply in his spirit and saith why doth this generation seek a sign verily i say unto you there shall no sign be given unto this generation and he left them and again entering into the boat departed to the other side and they forgot to take bread and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf and he charged them saying take heed beware of the leaven of the pharisees and the leaven of herod and they reasoned one with another saying we have no bread and jesus perceiving it saith unto them why reason ye because ye have no bread do ye not yet perceive neither understand have ye your heart hardened having eyes see ye not and having ears hear ye not and do ye not remember when i brake the five loaves among the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces took ye up they say unto him twelve and when the seven among the four thousand how many basketfuls of broken pieces took ye up and they say unto him seven and he said unto them do ye not yet understand and they come unto bethsaida and they bring to him a blind man and beseech him to touch him and he took hold of the blind man by the hand and brought him out of the village and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands upon him he asked him seest thou aught and he looked up and said i see men for i behold them as trees walking then again he laid his hands upon his eyes and he looked stedfastly and was restored and saw all things clearly and he sent him away to his home saying do not even enter into the village and jesus went forth and his disciples into the villages of c sarea philippi and on the way he asked his disciples saying unto them who do men say that i am and they told him saying john the baptist and others elijah but others one of the prophets and he asked them but who say ye that i am peter answereth and saith unto him thou art the christ and he charged them that they should tell no man of him and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again and he spake the saying openly and peter took him and began to rebuke him but he turning about and seeing his disciples rebuked peter and saith get thee behind me satan for thou mindest not the things of god but the things of men and he called unto him the multitude with his disciples and said unto them if any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever would save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel s shall save it for what doth it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life for what should a man give in exchange for his life for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation the son of man also shall be ashamed of him when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels and he said unto them verily i say unto you there are some here of them that stand by who shall in no wise taste of death till they see the kingdom of god come with power and after six days jesus taketh with him peter and james and john and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them and his garments became glistering exceeding white so as no fuller on earth can whiten them and there appeared unto them elijah with moses and they were talking with jesus and peter answereth and saith to jesus rabbi it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elijah for he knew not what to answer for they became sore afraid and there came a cloud overshadowing them and there came a voice out of the cloud this is my beloved son hear ye him and suddenly looking round about they saw no one any more save jesus only with themselves and as they were coming down from the mountain he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen save when the son of man should have risen again from the dead and they kept the saying questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean and they asked him saying how is it that the scribes say that elijah must first come and he said unto them elijah indeed cometh first and restoreth all things and how is it written of the son of man that he should suffer many things and be set at nought but i say unto you that elijah is come and they have also done unto him whatsoever they would even as it is written of him and when they came to the disciples they saw a great multitude about them and scribes questioning with them and straightway all the multitude when they saw him were greatly amazed and running to him saluted him and he asked them what question ye with them and one of the multitude answered him teacher i brought unto thee my son who hath a dumb spirit and wheresoever it taketh him it dasheth him down and he foameth and grindeth his teeth and pineth away and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out and they were not able and he answereth them and saith o faithless generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i bear with you bring him unto me and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tare him grievously and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long time is it since this hath come unto him and he said from a child and oft times it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou canst do anything have compassion on us and help us and jesus said unto him if thou canst all things are possible to him that believeth straightway the father of the child cried out and said i believe help thou mine unbelief and when jesus saw that a multitude came running together he rebuked the unclean spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i command thee come out of him and enter no more into him and having cried out and torn him much he came out and the boy became as one dead insomuch that the more part said he is dead but jesus took him by the hand and raised him up and he arose and when he was come into the house his disciples asked him privately how is it that we could not cast it out and he said unto them this kind can come out by nothing save by prayer and they went forth from thence and passed through galilee and he would not that any man should know it for he taught his disciples and said unto them the son of man is delivered up into the hands of men and they shall kill him and when he is killed after three days he shall rise again but they understood not the saying and were afraid to ask him and they came to capernaum and when he was in the house he asked them what were ye reasoning on the way but they held their peace for they had disputed one with another on the way who was the greatest and he sat down and called the twelve and he saith unto them if any man would be first he shall be last of all and servant of all and he took a little child and set him in the midst of them and taking him in his arms he said unto them whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name receiveth me and whosoever receiveth me receiveth not me but him that sent me john said unto him teacher we saw one casting out demons in thy name and we forbade him because he followed not us but jesus said forbid him not for there is no man who shall do a mighty work in my name and be able quickly to speak evil of me for he that is not against us is for us for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink because ye are christ s verily i say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward and whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea and if thy hand cause thee to stumble cut it off it is good for thee to enter into life maimed rather than having thy two hands to go into hell into the unquenchable fire and if thy foot cause thee to stumble cut it off it is good for thee to enter into life halt rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell and if thine eye cause thee to stumble cast it out it is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched for every one shall be salted with fire salt is good but if the salt have lost its saltness wherewith will ye season it have salt in yourselves and be at peace one with another and he arose from thence and cometh into the borders of jud a and beyond the jordan and multitudes come together unto him again and as he was wont he taught them again and there came unto him pharisees and asked him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife trying him and he answered and said unto them what did moses command you and they said moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and to put her away but jesus said unto them for your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment but from the beginning of the creation male and female made he them for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh so that they are no more two but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder and in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter and he saith unto them whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her and if she herself shall put away her husband and marry another she committeth adultery and they were bringing unto him little children that he should touch them and the disciples rebuked them but when jesus saw it he was moved with indignation and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me forbid them not for to such belongeth the kingdom of god verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall in no wise enter therein and he took them in his arms and blessed them laying his hands upon them and as he was going forth into the way there ran one to him and kneeled to him and asked him good teacher what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good none is good save one even god thou knowest the commandments do not kill do not commit adultery do not steal do not bear false witness do not defraud honor thy father and mother and he said unto him teacher all these things have i observed from my youth and jesus looking upon him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me but his countenance fell at the saying and he went away sorrowful for he was one that had great possessions and jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god and the disciples were amazed at his words but jesus answereth again and saith unto them children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god it is easier for a camel to go through a needle s eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and they were astonished exceedingly saying unto him then who can be saved jesus looking upon them saith with men it is impossible but not with god for all things are possible with god peter began to say unto him lo we have left all and have followed thee jesus said verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for my sake and for the gospel s sake but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life but many that are first shall be last and the last first and they were on the way going up to jerusalem and jesus was going before them and they were amazed and they that followed were afraid and he took again the twelve and began to tell them the things that were to happen unto him saying behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him unto the gentiles and they shall mock him and shall spit upon him and shall scourge him and shall kill him and after three days he shall rise again and there come near unto him james and john the sons of zebedee saying unto him teacher we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee and he said unto them what would ye that i should do for you and they said unto him grant unto us that we may sit one on thy right hand and one on thy left hand in thy glory but jesus said unto them ye know not what ye ask are ye able to drink the cup that i drink or to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with and they said unto him we are able and jesus said unto them the cup that i drink ye shall drink and with the baptism that i am baptized withal shall ye be baptized but to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give but it is for them for whom it hath been prepared and when the ten heard it they began to be moved with indignation concerning james and john and jesus called them to him and saith unto them ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the gentiles lord it over them and their great ones exercise authority over them but it is not so among you but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister and whosoever would be first among you shall be servant of all for the son of man also came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many and they come to jericho and as he went out from jericho with his disciples and a great multitude the son of tim us bartim us a blind beggar was sitting by the way side and when he heard that it was jesus the nazarene he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and many rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried out the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood still and said call ye him and they call the blind man saying unto him be of good cheer rise he calleth thee and he casting away his garment sprang up and came to jesus and jesus answered him and said what wilt thou that i should do unto thee and the blind man said unto him rabboni that i may receive my sight and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole and straightway he received his sight and followed him in the way and when they draw nigh unto jerusalem unto bethphage and bethany at the mount of olives he sendeth two of his disciples and saith unto them go your way into the village that is over against you and straightway as ye enter into it ye shall find a colt tied whereon no man ever yet sat loose him and bring him and if any one say unto you why do ye this say ye the lord hath need of him and straightway he will send him back hither and they went away and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street and they loose him and certain of them that stood there said unto them what do ye loosing the colt and they said unto them even as jesus had said and they let them go and they bring the colt unto jesus and cast on him their garments and he sat upon him and many spread their garments upon the way and others branches which they had cut from the fields and they that went before and they that followed cried hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord blessed is the kingdom that cometh the kingdom of our father david hosanna in the highest and he entered into jerusalem into the temple and when he had looked round about upon all things it being now eventide he went out unto bethany with the twelve and on the morrow when they were come out from bethany he hungered and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if haply he might find anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season of figs and he answered and said unto it no man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever and his disciples heard it and they come to jerusalem and he entered into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold the doves and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple and he taught and said unto them is it not written my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations but ye have made it a den of robbers and the chief priests and the scribes heard it and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching and every evening he went forth out of the city and as they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him rabbi behold the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god verily i say unto you whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou taken up and cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass he shall have it therefore i say unto you all things whatsoever ye pray and ask for believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them and whensoever ye stand praying forgive if ye have aught against any one that your father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses and they come again to jerusalem and as he was walking in the temple there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders and they said unto him by what authority doest thou these things or who gave thee this authority to do these things and jesus said unto them i will ask of you one question and answer me and i will tell you by what authority i do these things the baptism of john was it from heaven or from men answer me and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why then did ye not believe him but should we say from men they feared the people for all verily held john to be a prophet and they answered jesus and say we know not and jesus saith unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things and he began to speak unto them in parables a man planted a vineyard and set a hedge about it and digged a pit for the winepress and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into another country and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard and they took him and beat him and sent him away empty and again he sent unto them another servant and him they wounded in the head and handled shamefully and he sent another and him they killed and many others beating some and killing some he had yet one a beloved son he sent him last unto them saying they will reverence my son but those husbandmen said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours and they took him and killed him and cast him forth out of the vineyard what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do he will come and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others have ye not read even this scripture the stone which the builders rejected the same was made the head of the corner this was from the lord and it is marvellous in our eyes and they sought to lay hold on him and they feared the multitude for they perceived that he spake the parable against them and they left him and went away and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians that they might catch him in talk and when they were come they say unto him teacher we know that thou art true and carest not for any one for thou regardest not the person of men but of a truth teachest the way of god is it lawful to give tribute unto c sar or not shall we give or shall we not give but he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them why make ye trial of me bring me a denarius that i may see it and they brought it and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription and they said unto him c sar s and jesus said unto them render unto c sar the things that are c sar s and unto god the things that are god s and they marvelled greatly at him and there come unto him sadducees who say that there is no resurrection and they asked him saying teacher moses wrote unto us if a man s brother die and leave a wife behind him and leave no child that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and dying left no seed and the second took her and died leaving no seed behind him and the third likewise and the seven left no seed last of all the woman also died in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them for the seven had her to wife jesus said unto them is it not for this cause that ye err that ye know not the scriptures nor the power of god for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as angels in heaven but as touching the dead that they are raised have ye not read in the book of moses in the place concerning the bush how god spake unto him saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is not the god of the dead but of the living ye do greatly err and one of the scribes came and heard them questioning together and knowing that he had answered them well asked him what commandment is the first of all jesus answered the first is hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength the second is this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these and the scribe said unto him of a truth teacher thou hast well said that he is one and there is none other but he and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength and to love his neighbor as himself is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after that durst ask him any question and jesus answered and said as he taught in the temple how say the scribes that the christ is the son of david david himself said in the holy spirit the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet david himself calleth him lord and whence is he his son and the common people heard him gladly and in his teaching he said beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes and to have salutations in the marketplaces and chief seats in the synagogues and chief places at feasts they that devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater condemnation and he sat down over against the treasury and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in much and there came a poor widow and she cast in two mites which make a farthing and he called unto him his disciples and said unto them verily i say unto you this poor widow cast in more than all they that are casting into the treasury for they all did cast in of their superfluity but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living and as he went forth out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto him teacher behold what manner of stones and what manner of buildings and jesus said unto him seest thou these great buildings there shall not be left here one stone upon another which shall not be thrown down and as he sat on the mount of olives over against the temple peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished and jesus began to say unto them take heed that no man lead you astray many shall come in my name saying i am he and shall lead many astray and when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars be not troubled these things must needs come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there shall be earthquakes in divers places there shall be famines these things are the beginning of travail but take ye heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to councils and in synagogues shall ye be beaten and before governors and kings shall ye stand for my sake for a testimony unto them and the gospel must first be preached unto all the nations and when they lead you to judgment and deliver you up be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it is not ye that speak but the holy spirit and brother shall deliver up brother to death and the father his child and children shall rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death and ye shall be hated of all men for my name s sake but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved but when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not let him that readeth understand then let them that are in jud a flee unto the mountains and let him that is on the housetop not go down nor enter in to take anything out of his house and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days and pray ye that it be not in the winter for those days shall be tribulation such as there hath not been the like from the beginning of the creation which god created until now and never shall be and except the lord had shortened the days no flesh would have been saved but for the elect s sake whom he chose he shortened the days and then if any man shall say unto you lo here is the christ or lo there believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show signs and wonders that they may lead astray if possible the elect but take ye heed behold i have told you all things beforehand but in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall be falling from heaven and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory and then shall he send forth the angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven now from the fig tree learn her parable when her branch is now become tender and putteth forth its leaves ye know that the summer is nigh even so ye also when ye see these things coming to pass know ye that he is nigh even at the doors verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away until all these things be accomplished heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but of that day or that hour knoweth no one not even the angels in heaven neither the son but the father take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is it is as when a man sojourning in another country having left his house and given authority to his servants to each one his work commanded also the porter to watch watch therefore for ye know not when the lord of the house cometh whether at even or at midnight or at cockcrowing or in the morning lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping and what i say unto you i say unto all watch now after two days was the feast of the passover and the unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him with subtlety and kill him for they said not during the feast lest haply there shall be a tumult of the people and while he was in bethany in the house of simon the leper as he sat at meat there came a woman having an alabaster cruse of ointment of pure nard very costly and she brake the cruse and poured it over his head but there were some that had indignation among themselves saying to what purpose hath this waste of the ointment been made for this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred shillings and given to the poor and they murmured against her but jesus said let her alone why trouble ye her she hath wrought a good work on me for ye have the poor always with you and whensoever ye will ye can do them good but me ye have not always she hath done what she could she hath anointed my body beforehand for the burying and verily i say unto you wheresoever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her and judas iscariot he that was one of the twelve went away unto the chief priests that he might deliver him unto them and they when they heard it were glad and promised to give him money and he sought how he might conveniently deliver him unto them and on the first day of unleavened bread when they sacrificed the passover his disciples say unto him where wilt thou that we go and make ready that thou mayest eat the passover and he sendeth two of his disciples and saith unto them go into the city and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him and wheresoever he shall enter in say to the master of the house the teacher saith where is my guest chamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples and he will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready and there make ready for us and the disciples went forth and came into the city and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover and when it was evening he cometh with the twelve and as they sat and were eating jesus said verily i say unto you one of you shall betray me even he that eateth with me they began to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one is it i and he said unto them it is one of the twelve he that dippeth with me in the dish for the son of man goeth even as it is written of him but woe unto that man through whom the son of man is betrayed good were it for that man if he had not been born and as they were eating he took bread and when he had blessed he brake it and gave to them and said take ye this is my body and he took a cup and when he had given thanks he gave to them and they all drank of it and he said unto them this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many verily i say unto you i shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new in the kingdom of god and when they had sung a hymn they went out unto the mount of olives and jesus saith unto them all ye shall be offended for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered abroad howbeit after i am raised up i will go before you into galilee but peter said unto him although all shall be offended yet will not i and jesus saith unto him verily i say unto thee that thou to day even this night before the cock crow twice shalt deny me thrice but he spake exceeding vehemently if i must die with thee i will not deny thee and in like manner also said they all and they come unto a place which was named gethsemane and he saith unto his disciples sit ye here while i pray and he taketh with him peter and james and john and began to be greatly amazed and sore troubled and he saith unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death abide ye here and watch and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass away from him and he said abba father all things are possible unto thee remove this cup from me howbeit not what i will but what thou wilt and he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto peter simon sleepest thou couldest thou not watch one hour watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak and again he went away and prayed saying the same words and again he came and found them sleeping for their eyes were very heavy and they knew not what to answer him and he cometh the third time and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners arise let us be going behold he that betrayeth me is at hand and straightway while he yet spake cometh judas one of the twelve and with him a multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders now he that betrayed him had given them a token saying whomsoever i shall kiss that is he take him and lead him away safely and when he was come straightway he came to him and saith rabbi and kissed him and they laid hands on him and took him but a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword and smote the servant of the high priest and struck off his ear and jesus answered and said unto them are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me i was daily with you in the temple teaching and ye took me not but this is done that the scriptures might be fulfilled and they all left him and fled and a certain young man followed with him having a linen cloth cast about him over his naked body and they lay hold on him but he left the linen cloth and fled naked and they led jesus away to the high priest and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes and peter had followed him afar off even within into the court of the high priest and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself in the light of the fire now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against jesus to put him to death and found it not for many bare false witness against him and their witness agreed not together and there stood up certain and bare false witness against him saying we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and in three days i will build another made without hands and not even so did their witness agree together and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesus saying answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee but he held his peace and answered nothing again the high priest asked him and saith unto him art thou the christ the son of the blessed and jesus said i am and ye shall see the son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven and the high priest rent his clothes and saith what further need have we of witnesses ye have heard the blasphemy what think ye and they all condemned him to be worthy of death and some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him prophesy and the officers received him with blows of their hands and as peter was beneath in the court there cometh one of the maids of the high priest and seeing peter warming himself she looked upon him and saith thou also wast with the nazarene even jesus but he denied saying i neither know nor understand what thou sayest and he went out into the porch and the cock crew and the maid saw him and began again to say to them that stood by this is one of them but he again denied it and after a little while again they that stood by said to peter of a truth thou art one of them for thou art a galil an but he began to curse and to swear i know not this man of whom ye speak and straightway the second time the cock crew and peter called to mind the word how that jesus said unto him before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice and when he thought thereon he wept and straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole council held a consultation and bound jesus and carried him away and delivered him up to pilate and pilate asked him art thou the king of the jews and he answering saith unto him thou sayest and the chief priests accused him of many things and pilate again asked him saying answerest thou nothing behold how many things they accuse thee of but jesus no more answered anything insomuch that pilate marvelled now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner whom they asked of him and there was one called barabbas lying bound with them that had made insurrection men who in the insurrection had committed murder and the multitude went up and began to ask him to do as he was wont to do unto them and pilate answered them saying will ye that i release unto you the king of the jews for he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up but the chief priests stirred up the multitude that he should rather release barabbas unto them and pilate again answered and said unto them what then shall i do unto him whom ye call the king of the jews and they cried out again crucify him and pilate said unto them why what evil hath he done but they cried out exceedingly crucify him and pilate wishing to content the multitude released unto them barabbas and delivered jesus when he had scourged him to be crucified and the soldiers led him away within the court which is the pr torium and they call together the whole band and they clothe him with purple and platting a crown of thorns they put it on him and they began to salute him hail king of the jews and they smote his head with a reed and spat upon him and bowing their knees worshipped him and when they had mocked him they took off from him the purple and put on him his garments and they lead him out to crucify him and they compel one passing by simon of cyrene coming from the country the father of alexander and rufus to go with them that he might bear his cross and they bring him unto the place golgotha which is being interpreted the place of a skull and they offered him wine mingled with myrrh but he received it not and they crucify him and part his garments among them casting lots upon them what each should take and it was the third hour and they crucified him and the superscription of his accusation was written over the king of the jews and with him they crucify two robbers one on his right hand and one on his left and they that passed by railed on him wagging their heads and saying ha thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself and come down from the cross in like manner also the chief priests mocking him among themselves with the scribes said he saved others himself he cannot save let the christ the king of israel now come down from the cross that we may see and believe and they that were crucified with him reproached him and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice eloi eloi lama sabachthani which is being interpreted my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and some of them that stood by when they heard it said behold he calleth elijah and one ran and filling a sponge full of vinegar put it on a reed and gave him to drink saying let be let us see whether elijah cometh to take him down and jesus uttered a loud voice and gave up the ghost and the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom and when the centurion who stood by over against him saw that he so gave up the ghost he said truly this man was the son of god and there were also women beholding from afar among whom were both mary magdalene and mary the mother of james the less and of joses and salome who when he was in galilee followed him and ministered unto him and many other women that came up with him unto jerusalem and when even was now come because it was the preparation that is the day before the sabbath there came joseph of arimath a a councillor of honorable estate who also himself was looking for the kingdom of god and he boldly went in unto pilate and asked for the body of jesus and pilate marvelled if he were already dead and calling unto him the centurion he asked him whether he had been any while dead and when he learned it of the centurion he granted the corpse to joseph and he bought a linen cloth and taking him down wound him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses beheld where he was laid and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome bought spices that they might come and anoint him and very early on the first day of the week they come to the tomb when the sun was risen and they were saying among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb and looking up they see that the stone is rolled back for it was exceeding great and entering into the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side arrayed in a white robe and they were amazed and he saith unto them be not amazed ye seek jesus the nazarene who hath been crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go tell his disciples and peter he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you and they went out and fled from the tomb for trembling and astonishment had come upon them and they said nothing to any one for they were afraid now when he was risen early on the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they heard that he was alive and had been seen of her disbelieved and after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them as they walked on their way into the country and they went away and told it unto the rest neither believed they them and afterward he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned and these signs shall accompany them that believe in my name shall they cast out demons they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall in no wise hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then the lord jesus after he had spoken unto them was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs that followed amen forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us even as they delivered them unto us who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word it seemed good to me also having traced the course of all things accurately from the first to write unto thee in order most excellent theophilus that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed there was in the days of herod king of jud a a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abijah and he had a wife of the daughters of aaron and her name was elisabeth and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless and they had no child because that elisabeth was barren and they both were now well stricken in years now it came to pass while he executed the priest s office before god in the order of his course according to the custom of the priest s office his lot was to enter into the temple of the lord and burn incense and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and zacharias was troubled when he saw him and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias because thy supplication is heard and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy spirit even from his mother s womb and many of the children of israel shall he turn unto the lord their god and he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to walk in the wisdom of the just to make ready for the lord a people prepared for him and zacharias said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife well stricken in years and the angel answering said unto him i am gabriel that stand in the presence of god and i was sent to speak unto thee and to bring thee these good tidings and behold thou shalt be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things shall come to pass because thou believedst not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season and the people were waiting for zacharias and they marvelled while he tarried in the temple and when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple and he continued making signs unto them and remained dumb and it came to pass when the days of his ministration were fulfilled he departed unto his house and after these days elisabeth his wife conceived and she hid herself five months saying thus hath the lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon me to take away my reproach among men now in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin s name was mary and he came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favored the lord is with thee but she was greatly troubled at the saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the most high and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there shall be no end and mary said unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy spirit shall come upon thee and the power of the most high shall overshadow thee wherefore also the holy thing which is begotten shall be called the son of god and behold elisabeth thy kinswoman she also hath conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren for no word from god shall be void of power and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her and mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elisabeth and it came to pass when elisabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elisabeth was filled with the holy spirit and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come unto me for behold when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the lord and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour for he hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaid for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name and his mercy is unto generations and generations on them that fear him he hath showed strength with his arm he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart he hath put down princes from their thrones and hath exalted them of low degree the hungry he hath filled with good things and the rich he hath sent empty away he hath given help to israel his servant that he might remember mercy as he spake unto our fathers toward abraham and his seed for ever and mary abode with her about three months and returned unto her house now elisabeth s time was fulfilled that she should be delivered and she brought forth a son and her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the lord had magnified his mercy towards her and they rejoiced with her and it came to pass on the eighth day that they came to circumcise the child and they would have called him zacharias after the name of his father and his mother answered and said not so but he shall be called john and they said unto her there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name and they made signs to his father what he would have him called and he asked for a writing tablet and wrote saying his name is john and they marvelled all and his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue loosed and he spake blessing god and fear came on all that dwelt round about them and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of jud a and all that heard them laid them up in their heart saying what then shall this child be for the hand of the lord was with him and his father zacharias was filled with the holy spirit and prophesied saying blessed be the lord the god of israel for he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us to show mercy towards our fathers and to remember his holy covenant the oath which he sware unto abraham our father to grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days yea and thou child shalt be called the prophet of the most high for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to make ready his ways to give knowledge of salvation unto his people in the remission of their sins because of the tender mercy of our god whereby the dayspring from on high shall visit us to shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto israel now it came to pass in those days there went out a decree from c sar augustus that all the world should be enrolled this was the first enrolment made when quirinius was governor of syria and all went to enrol themselves every one to his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into jud a to the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and family of david to enrol himself with mary who was betrothed to him being great with child and it came to pass while they were there the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn and there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field and keeping watch by night over their flock and an angel of the lord stood by them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them be not afraid for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people for there is born to you this day in the city of david a saviour who is christ the lord and this is the sign unto you ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased and it came to pass when the angels went away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing that is come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found both mary and joseph and the babe lying in the manger and when they saw it they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child and all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds but mary kept all these sayings pondering them in her heart and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen even as it was spoken unto them and when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him his name was called jesus which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of their purification according to the law of moses were fulfilled they brought him up to jerusalem to present him to the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and this man was righteous and devout looking for the consolation of israel and the holy spirit was upon him and it had been revealed unto him by the holy spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the lord s christ and he came in the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law then he received him into his arms and blessed god and said now lettest thou thy servant depart lord according to thy word in peace for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples a light for revelation to the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel and his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in israel and for a sign which is spoken against yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed and there was one anna a prophetess the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of asher she was of a great age having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity and she had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years who departed not from the temple worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day and coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto god and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of jerusalem and when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the lord they returned into galilee to their own city nazareth and the child grew and waxed strong filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him and his parents went every year to jerusalem at the feast of the passover and when he was twelve years old they went up after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days as they were returning the boy jesus tarried behind in jerusalem and his parents knew it not but supposing him to be in the company they went a day s journey and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance and when they found him not they returned to jerusalem seeking for him and it came to pass after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers and when they saw him they were astonished and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i sought thee sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me knew ye not that i must be in my father s house and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and he went down with them and came to nazareth and he was subject unto them and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and jesus advanced in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and men now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius c sar pontius pilate being governor of jud a and herod being tetrarch of galilee and his brother philip tetrarch of the region of itur a and trachonitis and lysanias tetrarch of abilene in the high priesthood of annas and caiaphas the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness and he came into all the region round about the jordan preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins as it is written in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet the voice of one crying in the wilderness make ye ready the way of the lord make his paths straight every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low and the crooked shall become straight and the rough ways smooth and all flesh shall see the salvation of god he said therefore to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him ye offspring of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham and even now the axe also lieth at the root of the trees every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire and the multitudes asked him saying what then must we do and he answered and said unto them he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none and he that hath food let him do likewise and there came also publicans to be baptized and they said unto him teacher what must we do and he said unto them extort no more than that which is appointed you and soldiers also asked him saying and we what must we do and he said unto them extort from no man by violence neither accuse any one wrongfully and be content with your wages and as the people were in expectation and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning john whether haply he were the christ john answered saying unto them all i indeed baptize you with water but there cometh he that is mightier than i the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you in the holy spirit and in fire whose fan is in his hand thoroughly to cleanse his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his garner but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire with many other exhortations therefore preached he good tidings unto the people but herod the tetrarch being reproved by him for herodias his brother s wife and for all the evil things which herod had done added this also to them all that he shut up john in prison now it came to pass when all the people were baptized that jesus also having been baptized and praying the heaven was opened and the holy spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove upon him and a voice came out of heaven thou art my beloved son in thee i am well pleased and jesus himself when he began to teach was about thirty years of age being the son as was supposed of joseph the son of heli the son of matthat the son of levi the son of melchi the son of jannai the son of joseph the son of mattathias the son of amos the son of nahum the son of esli the son of naggai the son of maath the son of mattathias the son of semein the son of josech the son of joda the son of joanan the son of rhesa the son of zerubbabel the son of shealtiel the son of neri the son of melchi the son of addi the son of cosam the son of elmadam the son of er the son of jesus the son of eliezer the son of jorim the son of matthat the son of levi the son of symeon the son of judas the son of joseph the son of jonam the son of eliakim the son of melea the son of menna the son of mattatha the son of nathan the son of david the son of jesse the son of obed the son of boaz the son of salmon the son of nahshon the son of amminadab the son of arni the son of hezron the son of perez the son of judah the son of jacob the son of isaac the son of abraham the son of terah the son of nahor the son of serug the son of reu the son of peleg the son of eber the son of shelah the son of cainan the son of arphaxad the son of shem the son of noah the son of lamech the son of methuselah the son of enoch the son of jared the son of mahalaleel the son of cainan the son of enos the son of seth the son of adam the son of god and jesus full of the holy spirit returned from the jordan and was led in the spirit in the wilderness during forty days being tempted of the devil and he did eat nothing in those days and when they were completed he hungered and the devil said unto him if thou art the son of god command this stone that it become bread and jesus answered unto him it is written man shall not live by bread alone and he led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him to thee will i give all this authority and the glory of them for it hath been delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will i give it if thou therefore wilt worship before me it shall all be thine and jesus answered and said unto him it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve and he led him to jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou art the son of god cast thyself down from hence for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee to guard thee and on their hands they shall bear thee up lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone and jesus answering said unto him it is said thou shalt not make trial of the lord thy god and when the devil had completed every temptation he departed from him for a season and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and a fame went out concerning him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and he entered as his custom was into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and he opened the book and found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor he hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and gave it back to the attendant and sat down and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them to day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears and all bare him witness and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this joseph s son and he said unto them doubtless ye will say unto me this parable physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done at capernaum do also here in thine own country and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is acceptable in his own country but of a truth i say unto you there were many widows in israel in the days of elijah when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when there came a great famine over all the land and unto none of them was elijah sent but only to zarephath in the land of sidon unto a woman that was a widow and there were many lepers in israel in the time of elisha the prophet and none of them was cleansed but only naaman the syrian and they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue as they heard these things and they rose up and cast him forth out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built that they might throw him down headlong but he passing through the midst of them went his way and he came down to capernaum a city of galilee and he was teaching them on the sabbath day and they were astonished at his teaching for his word was with authority and in the synagogue there was a man that had a spirit of an unclean demon and he cried out with a loud voice ah what have we to do with thee jesus thou nazarene art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him and when the demon had thrown him down in the midst he came out of him having done him no hurt and amazement came upon all and they spake together one with another saying what is this word for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they come out and there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about and he rose up from the synagogue and entered into the house of simon and simon s wife s mother was holden with a great fever and they besought him for her and he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them and when the sun was setting all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them and demons also came out from many crying out and saying thou art the son of god and rebuking them he suffered them not to speak because they knew that he was the christ and when it was day he came out and went into a desert place and the multitudes sought after him and came unto him and would have stayed him that he should not go from them but he said unto them i must preach the good tidings of the kingdom of god to the other cities also for therefore was i sent and he was preaching in the synagogues of galilee now it came to pass while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of god that he was standing by the lake of gennesaret and he saw two boats standing by the lake but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets and he entered into one of the boats which was simon s and asked him to put out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat and when he had left speaking he said unto simon put out into the deep and let down your nets for a draught and simon answered and said master we toiled all night and took nothing but at thy word i will let down the nets and when they had done this they inclosed a great multitude of fishes and their nets were breaking and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the boats so that they began to sink but simon peter when he saw it fell down at jesus knees saying depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord for he was amazed and all that were with him at the draught of the fishes which they had taken and so were also james and john sons of zebedee who were partners with simon and jesus said unto simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men and when they had brought their boats to land they left all and followed him and it came to pass while he was in one of the cities behold a man full of leprosy and when he saw jesus he fell on his face and besought him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean and he stretched forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou made clean and straightway the leprosy departed from him and he charged him to tell no man but go thy way and show thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as moses commanded for a testimony unto them but so much the more went abroad the report concerning him and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed of their infirmities but he withdrew himself in the deserts and prayed and it came to pass on one of those days that he was teaching and there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by who were come out of every village of galilee and jud a and jerusalem and the power of the lord was with him to heal and behold men bring on a bed a man that was palsied and they sought to bring him in and to lay him before him and not finding by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went up to the housetop and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the midst before jesus and seeing their faith he said man thy sins are forgiven thee and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason saying who is this that speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone but jesus perceiving their reasonings answered and said unto them why reason ye in your hearts which is easier to say thy sins are forgiven thee or to say arise and walk but that ye may know that the son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins he said unto him that was palsied i say unto thee arise and take up thy couch and go unto thy house and immediately he rose up before them and took up that whereon he lay and departed to his house glorifying god and amazement took hold on all and they glorified god and they were filled with fear saying we have seen strange things to day and after these things he went forth and beheld a publican named levi sitting at the place of toll and said unto him follow me and he forsook all and rose up and followed him and levi made him a great feast in his house and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others that were sitting at meat with them and the pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples saying why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners and jesus answering said unto them they that are in health have no need of a physician but they that are sick i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance and they said unto him the disciples of john fast often and make supplications likewise also the disciples of the pharisees but thine eat and drink and jesus said unto them can ye make the sons of the bride chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them but the days will come and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them then will they fast in those days and he spake also a parable unto them no man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment else he will rend the new and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old and no man putteth new wine into old wine skins else the new wine will burst the skins and itself will be spilled and the skins will perish but new wine must be put into fresh wine skins and no man having drunk old wine desireth new for he saith the old is good now it came to pass on a sabbath that he was going through the grainfields and his disciples plucked the ears and did eat rubbing them in their hands but certain of the pharisees said why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day and jesus answering them said have ye not read even this what david did when he was hungry he and they that were with him how he entered into the house of god and took and ate the showbread and gave also to them that were with him which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests alone and he said unto them the son of man is lord of the sabbath and it came to pass on another sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught and there was a man there and his right hand was withered and the scribes and the pharisees watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath that they might find how to accuse him but he knew their thoughts and he said to the man that had his hand withered rise up and stand forth in the midst and he arose and stood forth and jesus said unto them i ask you is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm to save a life or to destroy it and he looked round about on them all and said unto him stretch forth thy hand and he did so and his hand was restored but they were filled with madness and communed one with another what they might do to jesus and it came to pass in these days that he went out into the mountain to pray and he continued all night in prayer to god and when it was day he called his disciples and he chose from them twelve whom also he named apostles simon whom he also named peter and andrew his brother and james and john and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james the son of alph us and simon who was called the zealot and judas the son of james and judas iscariot who became a traitor and he came down with them and stood on a level place and a great multitude of his disciples and a great number of the people from all jud a and jerusalem and the sea coast of tyre and sidon who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed and all the multitude sought to touch him for power came forth from him and healed them all and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed are ye poor for yours is the kingdom of god blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled blessed are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man s sake rejoice in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the same manner did their fathers unto the prophets but woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your consolation woe unto you ye that are full now for ye shall hunger woe unto you ye that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets but i say unto you that hear love your enemies do good to them that hate you bless them that curse you pray for them that despitefully use you to him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also give to every one that asketh thee and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise and if ye love them that love you what thank have ye for even sinners love those that love them and if ye do good to them that do good to you what thank have ye for even sinners do the same and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thank have ye even sinners lend to sinners to receive again as much but love your enemies and do them good and lend never despairing and your reward shall be great and ye shall be sons of the most high for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil be ye merciful even as your father is merciful and judge not and ye shall not be judged and condemn not and ye shall not be condemned release and ye shall be released give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down shaken together running over shall they give into your bosom for with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again and he spake also a parable unto them can the blind guide the blind shall they not both fall into a pit the disciple is not above his teacher but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother s eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye or how canst thou say to thy brother brother let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother s eye for there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit for each tree is known by its own fruit for of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes the good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and the evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say every one that cometh unto me and heareth my words and doeth them i will show you to whom he is like he is like a man building a house who digged and went deep and laid a foundation upon the rock and when a flood arose the stream brake against that house and could not shake it because it had been well builded but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation against which the stream brake and straightway it fell in and the ruin of that house was great after he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people he entered into capernaum and a certain centurion s servant who was dear unto him was sick and at the point of death and when he heard concerning jesus he sent unto him elders of the jews asking him that he would come and save his servant and they when they came to jesus besought him earnestly saying he is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him for he loveth our nation and himself built us our synagogue and jesus went with them and when he was now not far from the house the centurion sent friends to him saying unto him lord trouble not thyself for i am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee but say the word and my servant shall be healed for i also am a man set under authority having under myself soldiers and i say to this one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it and when jesus heard these things he marvelled at him and turned and said unto the multitude that followed him i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel and they that were sent returning to the house found the servant whole and it came to pass soon afterwards that he went to a city called nain and his disciples went with him and a great multitude now when he drew near to the gate of the city behold there was carried out one that was dead the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not and he came nigh and touched the bier and the bearers stood still and he said young man i say unto thee arise and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he gave him to his mother and fear took hold on all and they glorified god saying a great prophet is arisen among us and god hath visited his people and this report went forth concerning him in the whole of jud a and all the region round about and the disciples of john told him of all these things and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to the lord saying art thou he that cometh or look we for another and when the men were come unto him they said john the baptist hath sent us unto thee saying art thou he that cometh or look we for another in that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits and on many that were blind he bestowed sight and he answered and said unto them go and tell john the things which ye have seen and heard the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up the poor have good tidings preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me and when the messengers of john were departed he began to say unto the multitudes concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness to behold a reed shaken with the wind but what went ye out to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they that are gorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings courts but what went ye out to see a prophet yea i say unto you and much more than a prophet this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face who shall prepare thy way before thee i say unto you among them that are born of women there is none greater than john yet he that is but little in the kingdom of god is greater than he and all the people when they heard and the publicans justified god being baptized with the baptism of john but the pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of god being not baptized of him whereunto then shall i liken the men of this generation and to what are they like they are like unto children that sit in the marketplace and call one to another who say we piped unto you and ye did not dance we wailed and ye did not weep for john the baptist is come eating no bread nor drinking wine and ye say he hath a demon the son of man is come eating and drinking and ye say behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners and wisdom is justified of all her children and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he entered into the pharisee s house and sat down to meat and behold a woman who was in the city a sinner and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the pharisee s house she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment and standing behind at his feet weeping she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the pharisee that had bidden him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him that she is a sinner and jesus answering said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he saith teacher say on a certain lender had two debtors the one owed five hundred shillings and the other fifty when they had not wherewith to pay he forgave them both which of them therefore will love him most simon answered and said he i suppose to whom he forgave the most and he said unto him thou hast rightly judged and turning to the woman he said unto simon seest thou this woman i entered into thy house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath wetted my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair thou gavest me no kiss but she since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but she hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that even forgiveth sins and he said unto the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace and it came to pass soon afterwards that he went about through cities and villages preaching and bringing the good tidings of the kingdom of god and with him the twelve and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary that was called magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out and joanna the wife of chuzas herod s steward and susanna and many others who ministered unto them of their substance and when a great multitude came together and they of every city resorted unto him he spake by a parable the sower went forth to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the way side and it was trodden under foot and the birds of the heaven devoured it and other fell on the rock and as soon as it grew it withered away because it had no moisture and other fell amidst the thorns and the thorns grew with it and choked it and other fell into the good ground and grew and brought forth fruit a hundredfold as he said these things he cried he that hath ears to hear let him hear and his disciples asked him what this parable might be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to the rest in parables that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of god and those by the way side are they that have heard then cometh the devil and taketh away the word from their heart that they may not believe and be saved and those on the rock are they who when they have heard receive the word with joy and these have no root who for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away and that which fell among the thorns these are they that have heard and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection and that in the good ground these are such as in an honest and good heart having heard the word hold it fast and bring forth fruit with patience and no man when he hath lighted a lamp covereth it with a vessel or putteth it under a bed but putteth it on a stand that they that enter in may see the light for nothing is hid that shall not be made manifest nor anything secret that shall not be known and come to light take heed therefore how ye hear for whosoever hath to him shall be given and whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that which he thinketh he hath and there came to him his mother and brethren and they could not come at him for the crowd and it was told him thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to see thee but he answered and said unto them my mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of god and do it now it came to pass on one of those days that he entered into a boat himself and his disciples and he said unto them let us go over unto the other side of the lake and they launched forth but as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake and they were filling with water and were in jeopardy and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we perish and he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and there was a calm and he said unto them where is your faith and being afraid they marvelled saying one to another who then is this that he commandeth even the winds and the water and they obey him and they arrived at the country of the gerasenes which is over against galilee and when he was come forth upon the land there met him a certain man out of the city who had demons and for a long time he had worn no clothes and abode not in any house but in the tombs and when he saw jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god i beseech thee torment me not for he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man for oftentimes it had seized him and he was kept under guard and bound with chains and fetters and breaking the bands asunder he was driven of the demon into the deserts and jesus asked him what is thy name and he said legion for many demons were entered into him and they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them and he gave them leave and the demons came out from the man and entered into the swine and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake and were drowned and when they that fed them saw what had come to pass they fled and told it in the city and in the country and they went out to see what had come to pass and they came to jesus and found the man from whom the demons were gone out sitting clothed and in his right mind at the feet of jesus and they were afraid and they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole and all the people of the country of the gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them for they were holden with great fear and he entered into a boat and returned but the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him but he sent him away saying return to thy house and declare how great things god hath done for thee and he went his way publishing throughout the whole city how great things jesus had done for him and as jesus returned the multitude welcomed him for they were all waiting for him and behold there came a man named jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at jesus feet and besought him to come into his house for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age and she was dying but as he went the multitudes thronged him and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years who had spent all her living upon physicians and could not be healed of any came behind him and touched the border of his garment and immediately the issue of her blood stanched and jesus said who is it that touched me and when all denied peter said and they that were with him master the multitudes press thee and crush thee but jesus said some one did touch me for i perceived that power had gone forth from me and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him and how she was healed immediately and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue s house saying thy daughter is dead trouble not the teacher but jesus hearing it answered him fear not only believe and she shall be made whole and when he came to the house he suffered not any man to enter in with him save peter and john and james and the father of the maiden and her mother and all were weeping and bewailing her but he said weep not for she is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead but he taking her by the hand called saying maiden arise and her spirit returned and she rose up immediately and he commanded that something be given her to eat and her parents were amazed but he charged them to tell no man what had been done and he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases and he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick and he said unto them take nothing for your journey neither staff nor wallet nor bread nor money neither have two coats and into whatsoever house ye enter there abide and thence depart and as many as receive you not when ye depart from that city shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them and they departed and went throughout the villages preaching the gospel and healing everywhere now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done and he was much perplexed because that it was said by some that john was risen from the dead and by some that elijah had appeared and by others that one of the old prophets was risen again and herod said john i beheaded but who is this about whom i hear such things and he sought to see him and the apostles when they were returned declared unto him what things they had done and he took them and withdrew apart to a city called bethsaida but the multitudes perceiving it followed him and he welcomed them and spake to them of the kingdom of god and them that had need of healing he cured and the day began to wear away and the twelve came and said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and country round about and lodge and get provisions for we are here in a desert place but he said unto them give ye them to eat and they said we have no more than five loaves and two fishes except we should go and buy food for all this people for they were about five thousand men and he said unto his disciples make them sit down in companies about fifty each and they did so and made them all sit down and he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude and they ate and were all filled and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces twelve baskets and it came to pass as he was praying apart the disciples were with him and he asked them saying who do the multitudes say that i am and they answering said john the baptist but others say elijah and others that one of the old prophets is risen again and he said unto them but who say ye that i am and peter answering said the christ of god but he charged them and commanded them to tell this to no man saying the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and the third day be raised up and he said unto all if any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever would save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what is a man profited if he gain the whole world and lose or forfeit his own self for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in his own glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels but i tell you of a truth there are some of them that stand here who shall in no wise taste of death till they see the kingdom of god and it came to pass about eight days after these sayings that he took with him peter and john and james and went up into the mountain to pray and as he was praying the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment became white and dazzling and behold there talked with him two men who were moses and elijah who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at jerusalem now peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep but when they were fully awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him and it came to pass as they were parting from him peter said unto jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elijah not knowing what he said and while he said these things there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my son my chosen hear ye him and when the voice came jesus was found alone and they held their peace and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen and it came to pass on the next day when they were come down from the mountain a great multitude met him and behold a man from the multitude cried saying teacher i beseech thee to look upon my son for he is mine only child and behold a spirit taketh him and he suddenly crieth out and it teareth him that he foameth and it hardly departeth from him bruising him sorely and i besought thy disciples to cast it out and they could not and jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you and bear with you bring hither thy son and as he was yet a coming the demon dashed him down and tare him grievously but jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father and they were all astonished at the majesty of god but while all were marvelling at all the things which he did he said unto his disciples let these words sink into your ears for the son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men but they understood not this saying and it was concealed from them that they should not perceive it and they were afraid to ask him about this saying and there arose a reasoning among them which of them was the greatest but when jesus saw the reasoning of their heart he took a little child and set him by his side and said unto them whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same is great and john answered and said master we saw one casting out demons in thy name and we forbade him because he followeth not with us but jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against you is for you and it came to pass when the days were well nigh come that he should be received up he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem and sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him and they did not receive him because his face was as though he were going to jerusalem and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven and consume them but he turned and rebuked them and they went to another village and as they went on the way a certain man said unto him i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest and jesus said unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head and he said unto another follow me but he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father but he said unto him leave the dead to bury their own dead but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of god and another also said i will follow thee lord but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house but jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god now after these things the lord appointed seventy others and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whither he himself was about to come and he said unto them the harvest indeed is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he send forth laborers into his harvest go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves carry no purse no wallet no shoes and salute no man on the way and into whatsoever house ye shall enter first say peace be to this house and if a son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon him but if not it shall turn to you again and in that same house remain eating and drinking such things as they give for the laborer is worthy of his hire go not from house to house and into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you eat such things as are set before you and heal the sick that are therein and say unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you but into whatsoever city ye shall enter and they receive you not go out into the streets thereof and say even the dust from your city that cleaveth to our feet we wipe off against you nevertheless know this that the kingdom of god is come nigh i say unto you it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom than for that city woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon which were done in you they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon in the judgment than for you and thou capernaum shalt thou be exalted unto heaven thou shalt be brought down unto hades he that heareth you heareth me and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me and the seventy returned with joy saying lord even the demons are subject unto us in thy name and he said unto them i beheld satan fallen as lightning from heaven behold i have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall in any wise hurt you nevertheless in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rejoice that your names are written in heaven in that same hour he rejoiced in the holy spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding and didst reveal them unto babes yea father for so it was well pleasing in thy sight all things have been delivered unto me of my father and no one knoweth who the son is save the father and who the father is save the son and he to whomsoever the son willeth to reveal him and turning to the disciples he said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see for i say unto you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see and saw them not and to hear the things which ye hear and heard them not and behold a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him saying teacher what shall i do to inherit eternal life and he said unto him what is written in the law how readest thou and he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt live but he desiring to justify himself said unto jesus and who is my neighbor jesus made answer and said a certain man was going down from jerusalem to jericho and he fell among robbers who both stripped him and beat him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance a certain priest was going down that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and in like manner a levite also when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he was moved with compassion and came to him and bound up his wounds pouring on them oil and wine and he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow he took out two shillings and gave them to the host and said take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more i when i come back again will repay thee which of these three thinkest thou proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers and he said he that showed mercy on him and jesus said unto him go and do thou likewise now as they went on their way he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named martha received him into her house and she had a sister called mary who also sat at the lord s feet and heard his word but martha was cumbered about much serving and she came up to him and said lord dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone bid her therefore that she help me but the lord answered and said unto her martha martha thou art anxious and troubled about many things but one thing is needful for mary hath chosen the good part which shall not be taken away from her and it came to pass as he was praying in a certain place that when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray even as john also taught his disciples and he said unto them when ye pray say father hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come give us day by day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us and bring us not into temptation and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say to him friend lend me three loaves for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey and i have nothing to set before him and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed i cannot rise and give thee i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened and of which of you that is a father shall his son ask a loaf and he give him a stone or a fish and he for a fish give him a serpent or if he shall ask an egg will he give him a scorpion if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him and he was casting out a demon that was dumb and it came to pass when the demon was gone out the dumb man spake and the multitudes marvelled but some of them said by beelzebub the prince of the demons casteth he out demons and others trying him sought of him a sign from heaven but he knowing their thoughts said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and a house divided against a house falleth and if satan also is divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand because ye say that i cast out demons by beelzebub and if i by beelzebub cast out demons by whom do your sons cast them out therefore shall they be your judges but if i by the finger of god cast out demons then is the kingdom of god come upon you when the strong man fully armed guardeth his own court his goods are in peace but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him he taketh from him his whole armor wherein he trusted and divideth his spoils he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth the unclean spirit when he is gone out of the man passeth through waterless places seeking rest and finding none he saith i will turn back unto my house whence i came out and when he is come he findeth it swept and garnished then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirits more evil than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first and it came to pass as he said these things a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the womb that bare thee and the breasts which thou didst suck but he said yea rather blessed are they that hear the word of god and keep it and when the multitudes were gathering together unto him he began to say this generation is an evil generation it seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of jonah for even as jonah became a sign unto the ninevites so shall also the son of man be to this generation the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and shall condemn them for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here the men of nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching of jonah and behold a greater than jonah is here no man when he hath lighted a lamp putteth it in a cellar neither under the bushel but on the stand that they which enter in may see the light the lamp of thy body is thine eye when thine eye is single thy whole body also is full of light but when it is evil thy body also is full of darkness look therefore whether the light that is in thee be not darkness if therefore thy whole body be full of light having no part dark it shall be wholly full of light as when the lamp with its bright shining doth give thee light now as he spake a pharisee asketh him to dine with him and he went in and sat down to meat and when the pharisee saw it he marvelled that he had not first bathed himself before dinner and the lord said unto him now ye the pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness ye foolish ones did not he that made the outside make the inside also but give for alms those things which are within and behold all things are clean unto you but woe unto you pharisees for ye tithe mint and rue and every herb and pass over justice and the love of god but these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone woe unto you pharisees for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues and the salutations in the marketplaces woe unto you for ye are as the tombs which appear not and the men that walk over them know it not and one of the lawyers answering saith unto him teacher in saying this thou reproachest us also and he said woe unto you lawyers also for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers woe unto you for ye build the tombs of the prophets and your fathers killed them so ye are witnesses and consent unto the works of your fathers for they killed them and ye build their tombs therefore also said the wisdom of god i will send unto them prophets and apostles and some of them they shall kill and persecute that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation from the blood of abel unto the blood of zachariah who perished between the altar and the sanctuary yea i say unto you it shall be required of this generation woe unto you lawyers for ye took away the key of knowledge ye entered not in yourselves and them that were entering in ye hindered and when he was come out from thence the scribes and the pharisees began to press upon him vehemently and to provoke him to speak of many things laying wait for him to catch something out of his mouth in the mean time when the many thousands of the multitude were gathered together insomuch that they trod one upon another he began to say unto his disciples first of all beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy but there is nothing covered up that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known wherefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light and what ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops and i say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do but i will warn you whom ye shall fear fear him who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear him are not five sparrows sold for two pence and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of god but the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not ye are of more value than many sparrows and i say unto you every one who shall confess me before men him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of god and every one who shall speak a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemeth against the holy spirit it shall not be forgiven and when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities be not anxious how or what ye shall answer or what ye shall say for the holy spirit shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say and one out of the multitude said unto him teacher bid my brother divide the inheritance with me but he said unto him man who made me a judge or a divider over you and he said unto them take heed and keep yourselves from all covetousness for a man s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully and he reasoned within himself saying what shall i do because i have not where to bestow my fruits and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns and build greater and there will i bestow all my grain and my goods and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink be merry but god said unto him thou foolish one this night is thy soul required of thee and the things which thou hast prepared whose shall they be so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward god and he said unto his disciples therefore i say unto you be not anxious for your life what ye shall eat nor yet for your body what ye shall put on for the life is more than the food and the body than the raiment consider the ravens that they sow not neither reap which have no store chamber nor barn and god feedeth them of how much more value are ye than the birds and which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto the measure of his life if then ye are not able to do even that which is least why are ye anxious concerning the rest consider the lilies how they grow they toil not neither do they spin yet i say unto you even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these but if god doth so clothe the grass in the field which to day is and to morrow is cast into the oven how much more shall he clothe you o ye of little faith and seek not ye what ye shall eat and what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind for all these things do the nations of the world seek after but your father knoweth that ye have need of these things yet seek ye his kingdom and these things shall be added unto you fear not little flock for it is your father s good pleasure to give you the kingdom sell that which ye have and give alms make for yourselves purses which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where no thief draweth near neither moth destroyeth for where your treasure is there will your heart be also let your loins be girded about and your lamps burning and be ye yourselves like unto men looking for their lord when he shall return from the marriage feast that when he cometh and knocketh they may straightway open unto him blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching verily i say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them sit down to meat and shall come and serve them and if he shall come in the second watch and if in the third and find them so blessed are those servants but know this that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming he would have watched and not have left his house to be broken through be ye also ready for in an hour that ye think not the son of man cometh and peter said lord speakest thou this parable unto us or even unto all and the lord said who then is the faithful and wise steward whom his lord shall set over his household to give them their portion of food in due season blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing of a truth i say unto you that he will set him over all that he hath but if that servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants and to eat and drink and to be drunken the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not and in an hour when he knoweth not and shall cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the unfaithful and that servant who knew his lord s will and made not ready nor did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes but he that knew not and did things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes and to whomsoever much is given of him shall much be required and to whom they commit much of him will they ask the more i came to cast fire upon the earth and what do i desire if it is already kindled but i have a baptism to be baptized with and how am i straitened till it be accomplished think ye that i am come to give peace in the earth i tell you nay but rather division for there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided three against two and two against three they shall be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against her mother mother in law against her daughter in law and daughter in law against her mother in law and he said to the multitudes also when ye see a cloud rising in the west straightway ye say there cometh a shower and so it cometh to pass and when ye see a south wind blowing ye say there will be a scorching heat and it cometh to pass ye hypocrites ye know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven but how is it that ye know not how to interpret this time and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right for as thou art going with thine adversary before the magistrate on the way give diligence to be quit of him lest haply he drag thee unto the judge and the judge shall deliver thee to the officer and the officer shall cast thee into prison i say unto thee thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou have paid the very last mite now there were some present at that very season who told him of the galil ans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices and he answered and said unto them think ye that these galil ans were sinners above all the galil ans because they have suffered these things i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all in like manner perish or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and killed them think ye that they were offenders above all the men that dwell in jerusalem i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish and he spake this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came seeking fruit thereon and found none and he said unto the vinedresser behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why doth it also cumber the ground and he answering saith unto him lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit thenceforth well but if not thou shalt cut it down and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day and behold a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and she was bowed together and could in no wise lift herself up and when jesus saw her he called her and said to her woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity and he laid his hands upon her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god and the ruler of the synagogue being moved with indignation because jesus had healed on the sabbath answered and said to the multitude there are six days in which men ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the day of the sabbath but the lord answered him and said ye hypocrites doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering and ought not this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan had bound lo these eighteen years to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath and as he said these things all his adversaries were put to shame and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him he said therefore unto what is the kingdom of god like and whereunto shall i liken it it is like unto a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast into his own garden and it grew and became a tree and the birds of the heaven lodged in the branches thereof and again he said whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god it is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till it was all leavened and he went on his way through cities and villages teaching and journeying on unto jerusalem and one said unto him lord are they few that are saved and he said unto them strive to enter in by the narrow door for many i say unto you shall seek to enter in and shall not be able when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord open to us and he shall answer and say to you i know you not whence ye are then shall ye begin to say we did eat and drink in thy presence and thou didst teach in our streets and he shall say i tell you i know not whence ye are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth when ye shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and yourselves cast forth without and they shall come from the east and west and from the north and south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god and behold there are last who shall be first and there are first who shall be last in that very hour there came certain pharisees saying to him get thee out and go hence for herod would fain kill thee and he said unto them go and say to that fox behold i cast out demons and perform cures to day and to morrow and the third day i am perfected nevertheless i must go on my way to day and to morrow and the day following for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem o jerusalem jerusalem that killeth the prophets and stoneth them that are sent unto her how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her own brood under her wings and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate and i say unto you ye shall not see me until ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord and it came to pass when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread that they were watching him and behold there was before him a certain man that had the dropsy and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath or not but they held their peace and he took him and healed him and let him go and he said unto them which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a well and will not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day and they could not answer again unto these things and he spake a parable unto those that were bidden when he marked how they chose out the chief seats saying unto them when thou art bidden of any man to a marriage feast sit not down in the chief seat lest haply a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him and he that bade thee and him shall come and say to thee give this man place and then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place but when thou art bidden go and sit down in the lowest place that when he that hath bidden thee cometh he may say to thee friend go up higher then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all that sit at meat with thee for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted and he said to him also that had bidden him when thou makest a dinner or a supper call not thy friends nor thy brethren nor thy kinsmen nor rich neighbors lest haply they also bid thee again and a recompense be made thee but when thou makest a feast bid the poor the maimed the lame the blind and thou shalt be blessed because they have not wherewith to recompense thee for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god but he said unto him a certain man made a great supper and he bade many and he sent forth his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him i have bought a field and i must needs go out and see it i pray thee have me excused and another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i go to prove them i pray thee have me excused and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come and the servant came and told his lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame and the servant said lord what thou didst command is done and yet there is room and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and constrain them to come in that my house may be filled for i say unto you that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper now there went with him great multitudes and he turned and said unto them if any man cometh unto me and hateth not his own father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own life also he cannot be my disciple whosoever doth not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you desiring to build a tower doth not first sit down and count the cost whether he have wherewith to complete it lest haply when he hath laid a foundation and is not able to finish all that behold begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish or what king as he goeth to encounter another king in war will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand or else while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassage and asketh conditions of peace so therefore whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple salt therefore is good but if even the salt have lost its savor wherewith shall it be seasoned it is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill men cast it out he that hath ears to hear let him hear now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near unto him to hear him and both the pharisees and the scribes murmured saying this man receiveth sinners and eateth with them and he spake unto them this parable saying what man of you having a hundred sheep and having lost one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it and when he hath found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and his neighbors saying unto them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep which was lost i say unto you that even so there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine righteous persons who need no repentance or what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece doth not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find it and when she hath found it she calleth together her friends and neighbors saying rejoice with me for i have found the piece which i had lost even so i say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of thy substance that falleth to me and he divided unto them his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there he wasted his substance with riotous living and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that country and he began to be in want and he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him but when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my father s have bread enough and to spare and i perish here with hunger i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight i am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants and he arose and came to his father but while he was yet afar off his father saw him and was moved with compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight i am no more worthy to be called thy son but the father said to his servants bring forth quickly the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and make merry for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be merry now his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew nigh to the house he heard music and dancing and he called to him one of the servants and inquired what these things might be and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound but he was angry and would not go in and his father came out and entreated him but he answered and said to his father lo these many years do i serve thee and i never transgressed a commandment of thine and yet thou never gavest me a kid that i might make merry with my friends but when this thy son came who hath devoured thy living with harlots thou killedst for him the fatted calf and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that is mine is thine but it was meet to make merry and be glad for this thy brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found and he said also unto the disciples there was a certain rich man who had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods and he called him and said unto him what is this that i hear of thee render the account of thy stewardship for thou canst be no longer steward and the steward said within himself what shall i do seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me i have not strength to dig to beg i am ashamed i am resolved what to do that when i am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses and calling to him each one of his lord s debtors he said to the first how much owest thou unto my lord and he said a hundred measures of oil and he said unto him take thy bond and sit down quickly and write fifty then said he to another and how much owest thou and he said a hundred measures of wheat he saith unto him take thy bond and write fourscore and his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light and i say unto you make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness that when it shall fail they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles he that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another s who will give you that which is your own no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon and the pharisees who were lovers of money heard all these things and they scoffed at him and he said unto them ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men but god knoweth your hearts for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of god the law and the prophets were until john from that time the gospel of the kingdom of god is preached and every man entereth violently into it but it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tittle of the law to fall every one that putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery now there was a certain rich man and he was clothed in purple and fine linen faring sumptuously every day and a certain beggar named lazarus was laid at his gate full of sores and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man s table yea even the dogs came and licked his sores and it came to pass that the beggar died and that he was carried away by the angels into abraham s bosom and the rich man also died and was buried and in hades he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom and he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am in anguish in this flame but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things and lazarus in like manner evil things but now here he is comforted and thou art in anguish and besides all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able and that none may cross over from thence to us and he said i pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest send him to my father s house for i have five brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment but abraham saith they have moses and the prophets let them hear them and he said nay father abraham but if one go to them from the dead they will repent and he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded if one rise from the dead and he said unto his disciples it is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come but woe unto him through whom they come it were well for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were thrown into the sea rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble take heed to yourselves if thy brother sin rebuke him and if he repent forgive him and if he sin against thee seven times in the day and seven times turn again to thee saying i repent thou shalt forgive him and the apostles said unto the lord increase our faith and the lord said if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye would say unto this sycamine tree be thou rooted up and be thou planted in the sea and it would obey you but who is there of you having a servant plowing or keeping sheep that will say unto him when he is come in from the field come straightway and sit down to meat and will not rather say unto him make ready wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serve me till i have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink doth he thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded even so ye also when ye shall have done all the things that are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which it was our duty to do and it came to pass as they were on the way to jerusalem that he was passing along the borders of samaria and galilee and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers who stood afar off and they lifted up their voices saying jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go and show yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back with a loud voice glorifying god and he fell upon his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan and jesus answering said were not the ten cleansed but where are the nine were there none found that returned to give glory to god save this stranger and he said unto him arise and go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole and being asked by the pharisees when the kingdom of god cometh he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or there for lo the kingdom of god is within you and he said unto the disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and ye shall not see it and they shall say to you lo there lo here go not away nor follow after them for as the lightning when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall the son of man be in his day but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it came to pass in the days of noah even so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they ate they drank they married they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise even as it came to pass in the days of lot they ate they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but in the day that lot went out from sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all after the same manner shall it be in the day that the son of man is revealed in that day he that shall be on the housetop and his goods in the house let him not go down to take them away and let him that is in the field likewise not return back remember lot s wife whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it i say unto you in that night there shall be two men on one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left there shall be two women grinding together the one shall be taken and the other shall be left and they answering say unto him where lord and he said unto them where the body is thither will the eagles also be gathered together and he spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to pray and not to faint saying there was in a city a judge who feared not god and regarded not man and there was a widow in that city and she came oft unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest she wear me out by her continual coming and the lord said hear what the unrighteous judge saith and shall not god avenge his elect that cry to him day and night and yet he is longsuffering over them i say unto you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and set all others at nought two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as the rest of men extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i get but the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote his breast saying god be thou merciful to me a sinner i say unto you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted and they were bringing unto him also their babes that he should touch them but when the disciples saw it they rebuked them but jesus called them unto him saying suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for to such belongeth the kingdom of god verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall in no wise enter therein and a certain ruler asked him saying good teacher what shall i do to inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good none is good save one even god thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honor thy father and mother and he said all these things have i observed from my youth up and when jesus heard it he said unto him one thing thou lackest yet sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me but when he heard these things he became exceeding sorrowful for he was very rich and jesus seeing him said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god for it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle s eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and they that heard it said then who can be saved but he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with god and peter said lo we have left our own and followed thee and he said unto them verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or wife or brethren or parents or children for the kingdom of god s sake who shall not receive manifold more in this time and in the world to come eternal life and he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and all the things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the son of man for he shall be delivered up unto the gentiles and shall be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon and they shall scourge and kill him and the third day he shall rise again and they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them and they perceived not the things that were said and it came to pass as he drew nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side begging and hearing a multitude going by he inquired what this meant and they told him that jesus of nazareth passeth by and he cried saying jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and they that went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried out the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked him what wilt thou that i should do unto thee and he said lord that i may receive my sight and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto god and he entered and was passing through jericho and behold a man called by name zacch us and he was a chief publican and he was rich and he sought to see jesus who he was and could not for the crowd because he was little of stature and he ran on before and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him for he was to pass that way and when jesus came to the place he looked up and said unto him zacch us make haste and come down for to day i must abide at thy house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmured saying he is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner and zacch us stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have wrongfully exacted aught of any man i restore fourfold and jesus said unto him to day is salvation come to this house forasmuch as he also is a son of abraham for the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost and as they heard these things he added and spake a parable because he was nigh to jerusalem and because they supposed that the kingdom of god was immediately to appear he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return and he called ten servants of his and gave them ten pounds and said unto them trade ye herewith till i come but his citizens hated him and sent an ambassage after him saying we will not that this man reign over us and it came to pass when he was come back again having received the kingdom that he commanded these servants unto whom he had given the money to be called to him that he might know what they had gained by trading and the first came before him saying lord thy pound hath made ten pounds more and he said unto him well done thou good servant because thou wast found faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities and the second came saying thy pound lord hath made five pounds and he said unto him also be thou also over five cities and another came saying lord behold here is thy pound which i kept laid up in a napkin for i feared thee because thou art an austere man thou takest up that which thou layedst not down and reapest that which thou didst not sow he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will i judge thee thou wicked servant thou knewest that i am an austere man taking up that which i laid not down and reaping that which i did not sow then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank and i at my coming should have required it with interest and he said unto them that stood by take away from him the pound and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds and they said unto him lord he hath ten pounds i say unto you that unto every one that hath shall be given but from him that hath not even that which he hath shall be taken away from him but these mine enemies that would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me and when he had thus spoken he went on before going up to jerusalem and it came to pass when he drew nigh unto bethphage and bethany at the mount that is called olivet he sent two of the disciples saying go your way into the village over against you in which as ye enter ye shall find a colt tied whereon no man ever yet sat loose him and bring him and if any one ask you why do ye loose him thus shall ye say the lord hath need of him and they that were sent went away and found even as he had said unto them and as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said unto them why loose ye the colt and they said the lord hath need of him and they brought him to jesus and they threw their garments upon the colt and set jesus thereon and as he went they spread their garments in the way and as he was now drawing nigh even at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen saying blessed is the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the pharisees from the multitude said unto him teacher rebuke thy disciples and he answered and said i tell you that if these shall hold their peace the stones will cry out and when he drew nigh he saw the city and wept over it saying if thou hadst known in this day even thou the things which belong unto peace but now they are hid from thine eyes for the days shall come upon thee when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side and shall dash thee to the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation and he entered into the temple and began to cast out them that sold saying unto them it is written and my house shall be a house of prayer but ye have made it a den of robbers and he was teaching daily in the temple but the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him and they could not find what they might do for the people all hung upon him listening and it came to pass on one of the days as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel there came upon him the chief priests and the scribes with the elders and they spake saying unto him tell us by what authority doest thou these things or who is he that gave thee this authority and he answered and said unto them i also will ask you a question and tell me the baptism of john was it from heaven or from men and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why did ye not believe him but if we shall say from men all the people will stone us for they are persuaded that john was a prophet and they answered that they knew not whence it was and jesus said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things and he began to speak unto the people this parable a man planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen and went into another country for a long time and at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty and he sent yet another servant and him also they beat and handled him shamefully and sent him away empty and he sent yet a third and him also they wounded and cast him forth and the lord of the vineyard said what shall i do i will send my beloved son it may be they will reverence him but when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned one with another saying this is the heir let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours and they cast him forth out of the vineyard and killed him what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them he will come and destroy these husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others and when they heard it they said god forbid but he looked upon them and said what then is this that is written the stone which the builders rejected the same was made the head of the corner every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces but on whomsoever it shall fall it will scatter him as dust and the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour and they feared the people for they perceived that he spake this parable against them and they watched him and sent forth spies who feigned themselves to be righteous that they might take hold of his speech so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor and they asked him saying teacher we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly and acceptest not the person of any but of a truth teachest the way of god is it lawful for us to give tribute unto c sar or not but he perceived their craftiness and said unto them show me a denarius whose image and superscription hath it and they said c sar s and he said unto them then render unto c sar the things that are c sar s and unto god the things that are god s and they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people and they marvelled at his answer and held their peace and there came to him certain of the sadducees they that say that there is no resurrection and they asked him saying teacher moses wrote unto us that if a man s brother die having a wife and he be childless his brother should take the wife and raise up seed unto his brother there were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife and died childless and the second and the third took her and likewise the seven also left no children and died afterward the woman also died in the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be for the seven had her to wife and jesus said unto them the sons of this world marry and are given in marriage but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage for neither can they die any more for they are equal unto the angels and are sons of god being sons of the resurrection but that the dead are raised even moses showed in the place concerning the bush when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob now he is not the god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him and certain of the scribes answering said teacher thou hast well said for they durst not any more ask him any question and he said unto them how say they that the christ is david s son for david himself saith in the book of psalms the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet david therefore calleth him lord and how is he his son and in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes and love salutations in the marketplaces and chief seats in the synagogues and chief places at feasts who devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater condemnation and he looked up and saw the rich men that were casting their gifts into the treasury and he saw a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites and he said of a truth i say unto you this poor widow cast in more than they all for all these did of their superfluity cast in unto the gifts but she of her want did cast in all the living that she had and as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings he said as for these things which ye behold the days will come in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and they asked him saying teacher when therefore shall these things be and what shall be the sign when these things are about to come to pass and he said take heed that ye be not led astray for many shall come in my name saying i am he and the time is at hand go ye not after them and when ye shall hear of wars and tumults be not terrified for these things must needs come to pass first but the end is not immediately then said he unto them nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be great earthquakes and in divers places famines and pestilences and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven but before all these things they shall lay their hands on you and shall persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons bringing you before kings and governors for my name s sake it shall turn out unto you for a testimony settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to withstand or to gainsay but ye shall be delivered up even by parents and brethren and kinsfolk and friends and some of you shall they cause to be put to death and ye shall be hated of all men for my name s sake and not a hair of your head shall perish in your patience ye shall win your souls but when ye see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that her desolation is at hand then let them that are in jud a flee unto the mountains and let them that are in the midst of her depart out and let not them that are in the country enter therein for these are days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress upon the land and wrath unto this people and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led captive into all the nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled and there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars and upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the billows men fainting for fear and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory but when these things begin to come to pass look up and lift up your heads because your redemption draweth nigh and he spake to them a parable behold the fig tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth ye see it and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh even so ye also when ye see these things coming to pass know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all things be accomplished heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but take heed to yourselves lest haply your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life and that day come on you suddenly as a snare for so shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of all the earth but watch ye at every season making supplication that ye may prevail to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man and every day he was teaching in the temple and every night he went out and lodged in the mount that is called olivet and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which is called the passover and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death for they feared the people and satan entered into judas who was called iscariot being of the number of the twelve and he went away and communed with the chief priests and captains how he might deliver him unto them and they were glad and covenanted to give him money and he consented and sought opportunity to deliver him unto them in the absence of the multitude and the day of unleavened bread came on which the passover must be sacrificed and he sent peter and john saying go and make ready for us the passover that we may eat and they said unto him where wilt thou that we make ready and he said unto them behold when ye are entered into the city there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him into the house whereinto he goeth and ye shall say unto the master of the house the teacher saith unto thee where is the guest chamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples and he will show you a large upper room furnished there make ready and they went and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover and when the hour was come he sat down and the apostles with him and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer for i say unto you i shall not eat it until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god and he received a cup and when he had given thanks he said take this and divide it among yourselves for i say unto you i shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come and he took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and gave to them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me and the cup in like manner after supper saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood even that which is poured out for you but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table for the son of man indeed goeth as it hath been determined but woe unto that man through whom he is betrayed and they began to question among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing and there arose also a contention among them which of them was accounted to be greatest and he said unto them the kings of the gentiles have lordship over them and they that have authority over them are called benefactors but ye shall not be so but he that is the greater among you let him become as the younger and he that is chief as he that doth serve for which is greater he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth is not he that sitteth at meat but i am in the midst of you as he that serveth but ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations and i appoint unto you a kingdom even as my father appointed unto me that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel simon simon behold satan asked to have you that he might sift you as wheat but i made supplication for thee that thy faith fail not and do thou when once thou hast turned again establish thy brethren and he said unto him lord with thee i am ready to go both to prison and to death and he said i tell thee peter the cock shall not crow this day until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me and he said unto them when i sent you forth without purse and wallet and shoes lacked ye anything and they said nothing and he said unto them but now he that hath a purse let him take it and likewise a wallet and he that hath none let him sell his cloak and buy a sword for i say unto you that this which is written must be fulfilled in me and he was reckoned with transgressors for that which concerneth me hath fulfilment and they said lord behold here are two swords and he said unto them it is enough and he came out and went as his custom was unto the mount of olives and the disciples also followed him and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation and he was parted from them about a stone s cast and he kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared unto him an angel from heaven strengthening him and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground and when he rose up from his prayer he came unto the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow and said unto them why sleep ye rise and pray that ye enter not into temptation while he yet spake behold a multitude and he that was called judas one of the twelve went before them and he drew near unto jesus to kiss him but jesus said unto him judas betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss and when they that were about him saw what would follow they said lord shall we smite with the sword and a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest and struck off his right ear but jesus answered and said suffer ye them thus far and he touched his ear and healed him and jesus said unto the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders that were come against him are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves when i was daily with you in the temple ye stretched not forth your hands against me but this is your hour and the power of darkness and they seized him and led him away and brought him into the high priest s house but peter followed afar off and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court and had sat down together peter sat in the midst of them and a certain maid seeing him as he sat in the light of the fire and looking stedfastly upon him said this man also was with him but he denied saying woman i know him not and after a little while another saw him and said thou also art one of them but peter said man i am not and after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed saying of a truth this man also was with him for he is a galil an but peter said man i know not what thou sayest and immediately while he yet spake the cock crew and the lord turned and looked upon peter and peter remembered the word of the lord how that he said unto him before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly and the men that held jesus mocked him and beat him and they blindfolded him and asked him saying prophesy who is he that struck thee and many other things spake they against him reviling him and as soon as it was day the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together both chief priests and scribes and they led him away into their council saying if thou art the christ tell us but he said unto them if i tell you ye will not believe and if i ask you ye will not answer but from henceforth shall the son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of god and they all said art thou then the son of god and he said unto them ye say that i am and they said what further need have we of witness for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth and the whole company of them rose up and brought him before pilate and they began to accuse him saying we found this man perverting our nation and forbidding to give tribute to c sar and saying that he himself is christ a king and pilate asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and he answered him and said thou sayest and pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes i find no fault in this man but they were the more urgent saying he stirreth up the people teaching throughout all jud a and beginning from galilee even unto this place but when pilate heard it he asked whether the man were a galil an and when he knew that he was of herod s jurisdiction he sent him unto herod who himself also was at jerusalem in these days now when herod saw jesus he was exceeding glad for he was of a long time desirous to see him because he had heard concerning him and he hoped to see some miracle done by him and he questioned him in many words but he answered him nothing and the chief priests and the scribes stood vehemently accusing him and herod with his soldiers set him at nought and mocked him and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to pilate and herod and pilate became friends with each other that very day for before they were at enmity between themselves and pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people and said unto them ye brought unto me this man as one that perverteth the people and behold i having examined him before you found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him no nor yet herod for he sent him back unto us and behold nothing worthy of death hath been done by him i will therefore chastise him and release him but they cried out all together saying away with this man and release unto us barabbas one who for a certain insurrection made in the city and for murder was cast into prison and pilate spake unto them again desiring to release jesus but they shouted saying crucify crucify him and he said unto them the third time why what evil hath this man done i have found no cause of death in him i will therefore chastise him and release him but they were urgent with loud voices asking that he might be crucified and their voices prevailed and pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done and he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison whom they asked for but jesus he delivered up to their will and when they led him away they laid hold upon one simon of cyrene coming from the country and laid on him the cross to bear it after jesus and there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who bewailed and lamented him but jesus turning unto them said daughters of jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming in which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the breasts that never gave suck then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us for if they do these things in the green tree what shall be done in the dry and there were also two others malefactors led with him to be put to death and when they came unto the place which is called the skull there they crucified him and the malefactors one on the right hand and the other on the left and jesus said father forgive them for they know not what they do and parting his garments among them they cast lots and the people stood beholding and the rulers also scoffed at him saying he saved others let him save himself if this is the christ of god his chosen and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him offering him vinegar and saying if thou art the king of the jews save thyself and there was also a superscription over him this is the king of the jews and one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him saying art not thou the christ save thyself and us but the other answered and rebuking him said dost thou not even fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss and he said jesus remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom and he said unto him verily i say unto thee to day shalt thou be with me in paradise and it was now about the sixth hour and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour the sun s light failing and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst and jesus crying with a loud voice said father into thy hands i commend my spirit and having said this he gave up the ghost and when the centurion saw what was done he glorified god saying certainly this was a righteous man and all the multitudes that came together to this sight when they beheld the things that were done returned smiting their breasts and all his acquaintance and the women that followed with him from galilee stood afar off seeing these things and behold a man named joseph who was a councillor a good and righteous man he had not consented to their counsel and deed a man of arimath a a city of the jews who was looking for the kingdom of god this man went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus and he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone where never man had yet lain and it was the day of the preparation and the sabbath drew on and the women who had come with him out of galilee followed after and beheld the tomb and how his body was laid and they returned and prepared spices and ointments and on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment but on the first day of the week at early dawn they came unto the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared and they found the stone rolled away from the tomb and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus and it came to pass while they were perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in dazzling apparel and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee saying that the son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again and they remembered his words and returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest now they were mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles and these words appeared in their sight as idle talk and they disbelieved them but peter arose and ran unto the tomb and stooping and looking in he seeth the linen cloths by themselves and he departed to his home wondering at that which was come to pass and behold two of them were going that very day to a village named emmaus which was threescore furlongs from jerusalem and they communed with each other of all these things which had happened and it came to pass while they communed and questioned together that jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holden that they should not know him and he said unto them what communications are these that ye have one with another as ye walk and they stood still looking sad and one of them named cleopas answering said unto him dost thou alone sojourn in jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him the things concerning jesus the nazarene who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death and crucified him but we hoped that it was he who should redeem israel yea and besides all this it is now the third day since these things came to pass moreover certain women of our company amazed us having been early at the tomb and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive and certain of them that were with us went to the tomb and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not and he said unto them o foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken behooved it not the christ to suffer these things and to enter into his glory and beginning from moses and from all the prophets he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew nigh unto the village whither they were going and he made as though he would go further and they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent and he went in to abide with them and it came to pass when he had sat down with them to meat he took the bread and blessed and breaking it he gave to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another was not our heart burning within us while he spake to us in the way while he opened to us the scriptures and they rose up that very hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to simon and they rehearsed the things that happened in the way and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread and as they spake these things he himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they beheld a spirit and he said unto them why are ye troubled and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart see my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye behold me having and when he had said this he showed them his hands and his feet and while they still disbelieved for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here anything to eat and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and he took it and ate before them and he said unto them these are my words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must needs be fulfilled which are written in the law of moses and the prophets and the psalms concerning me then opened he their mind that they might understand the scriptures and he said unto them thus it is written that the christ should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations beginning from jerusalem ye are witnesses of these things and behold i send forth the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city until ye be clothed with power from on high and he led them out until they were over against bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he parted from them and was carried up into heaven and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple blessing god
